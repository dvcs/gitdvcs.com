<p>git *</p>

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This tutorial explains how to use the &ldquo;core&rdquo; Git commands to set up and
work with a Git repository.</p>

<p>If you just need to use Git as a revision control system you may prefer
to start with &ldquo;A Tutorial Introduction to Git&rdquo;
(<a href="../gittutorial">gittutorial(7)</a>) or <a href="user-manual">the Git User
Manual</a>.</p>

<p>However, an understanding of these low-level tools can be helpful if you
want to understand Git’s internals.</p>

<p>The core Git is often called &ldquo;plumbing&rdquo;, with the prettier user
interfaces on top of it called &ldquo;porcelain&rdquo;. You may not want to use the
plumbing directly very often, but it can be good to know what the
plumbing does for when the porcelain isn’t flushing.</p>

<p>Back when this document was originally written, many porcelain commands
were shell scripts. For simplicity, it still uses them as examples to
illustrate how plumbing is fit together to form the porcelain commands.
The source tree includes some of these scripts in contrib/examples/ for
reference. Although these are not implemented as shell scripts anymore,
the description of what the plumbing layer commands do is still valid.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-git-repository">Creating a Git repository</h2>

<p>Creating a new Git repository couldn’t be easier: all Git repositories
start out empty, and the only thing you need to do is find yourself a
subdirectory that you want to use as a working tree - either an empty
one for a totally new project, or an existing working tree that you want
to import into Git.</p>

<p>For our first example, we’re going to start a totally new repository
from scratch, with no pre-existing files, and we’ll call it
<em>git-tutorial</em>. To start up, create a subdirectory for it, change into
that subdirectory, and initialize the Git infrastructure with <em>git
init</em>:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir git-tutorial
$ cd git-tutorial
$ git init
</code></pre>

<p>to which Git will reply</p>

<pre><code>Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
</code></pre>

<p>which is just Git’s way of saying that you haven’t been doing anything
strange, and that it will have created a local <code>.git</code> directory setup
for your new project. You will now have a <code>.git</code> directory, and you can
inspect that with <em>ls</em>. For your new empty project, it should show you
three entries, among other things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a file called <code>HEAD</code>, that has <code>ref: refs/heads/master</code> in it. This
is similar to a symbolic link and points at <code>refs/heads/master</code>
relative to the <code>HEAD</code> file.</p>

<p>Don’t worry about the fact that the file that the <code>HEAD</code> link points
to doesn’t even exist yet — you haven’t created the commit that will
start your <code>HEAD</code> development branch yet.</p></li>

<li><p>a subdirectory called <code>objects</code>, which will contain all the objects
of your project. You should never have any real reason to look at
the objects directly, but you might want to know that these objects
are what contains all the real <em>data</em> in your repository.</p></li>

<li><p>a subdirectory called <code>refs</code>, which contains references to objects.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, the <code>refs</code> subdirectory will contain two other
subdirectories, named <code>heads</code> and <code>tags</code> respectively. They do exactly
what their names imply: they contain references to any number of
different <em>heads</em> of development (aka <em>branches</em>), and to any <em>tags</em>
that you have created to name specific versions in your repository.</p>

<p>One note: the special <code>master</code> head is the default branch, which is why
the <code>.git/HEAD</code> file was created points to it even if it doesn’t yet
exist. Basically, the <code>HEAD</code> link is supposed to always point to the
branch you are working on right now, and you always start out expecting
to work on the <code>master</code> branch.</p>

<p>However, this is only a convention, and you can name your branches
anything you want, and don’t have to ever even <em>have</em> a <code>master</code> branch.
A number of the Git tools will assume that <code>.git/HEAD</code> is valid, though.</p>

The files in the <code>refs</code> subdirectory are expected to contain these hex references (usually with a final <code>\n</code> at the end), and you should thus expect to see a number of 41-byte files containing these references in these <code>refs</code> subdirectories when you actually start populating your tree.</td>

<p>You have now created your first Git repository. Of course, since it’s
empty, that’s not very useful, so let’s start populating it with data.</p>

<h2 id="populating-a-git-repository">Populating a Git repository</h2>

<p>We’ll keep this simple and stupid, so we’ll start off with populating a
few trivial files just to get a feel for it.</p>

<p>Start off with just creating any random files that you want to maintain
in your Git repository. We’ll start off with a few bad examples, just to
get a feel for how this works:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo &quot;Hello World&quot; &gt;hello
$ echo &quot;Silly example&quot; &gt;example
</code></pre>

<p>you have now created two files in your working tree (aka <em>working
directory</em>), but to actually check in your hard work, you will have to
go through two steps:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>fill in the <em>index</em> file (aka <em>cache</em>) with the information about
your working tree state.</p></li>

<li><p>commit that index file as an object.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The first step is trivial: when you want to tell Git about any changes
to your working tree, you use the <em>git update-index</em> program. That
program normally just takes a list of filenames you want to update, but
to avoid trivial mistakes, it refuses to add new entries to the index
(or remove existing ones) unless you explicitly tell it that you’re
adding a new entry with the <code>--add</code> flag (or removing an entry with the
<code>--remove</code>) flag.</p>

<p>So to populate the index with the two files you just created, you can do</p>

<pre><code>$ git update-index --add hello example
</code></pre>

<p>and you have now told Git to track those two files.</p>

<p>In fact, as you did that, if you now look into your object directory,
you’ll notice that Git will have added two new objects to the object
database. If you did exactly the steps above, you should now be able to
do</p>

<pre><code>$ ls .git/objects/??/*
</code></pre>

<p>and see two files:</p>

<pre><code>.git/objects/55/7db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238
.git/objects/f2/4c74a2e500f5ee1332c86b94199f52b1d1d962
</code></pre>

<p>which correspond with the objects with names of <code>557db...</code> and
<code>f24c7...</code> respectively.</p>

<p>If you want to, you can use <em>git cat-file</em> to look at those objects, but
you’ll have to use the object name, not the filename of the object:</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file -t 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238
</code></pre>

<p>where the <code>-t</code> tells <em>git cat-file</em> to tell you what the &ldquo;type&rdquo; of the
object is. Git will tell you that you have a &ldquo;blob&rdquo; object (i.e., just a
regular file), and you can see the contents with</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file blob 557db03
</code></pre>

<p>which will print out &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;. The object <code>557db03</code> is nothing more
than the contents of your file <code>hello</code>.</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td><div class="title">
Note
</div></td>
<td>Don’t confuse that object with the file <code>hello</code> itself. The object is literally just those specific <strong>contents</strong> of the file, and however much you later change the contents in file <code>hello</code>, the object we just looked at will never change. Objects are immutable.</td>

</div></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Anyway, as we mentioned previously, you normally never actually take a
look at the objects themselves, and typing long 40-character hex names
is not something you’d normally want to do. The above digression was
just to show that <em>git update-index</em> did something magical, and actually
saved away the contents of your files into the Git object database.</p>

<p>Updating the index did something else too: it created a <code>.git/index</code>
file. This is the index that describes your current working tree, and
something you should be very aware of. Again, you normally never worry
about the index file itself, but you should be aware of the fact that
you have not actually really &ldquo;checked in&rdquo; your files into Git so far,
you’ve only <strong>told</strong> Git about them.</p>

<p>However, since Git knows about them, you can now start using some of the
most basic Git commands to manipulate the files or look at their status.</p>

<p>In particular, let’s not even check in the two files into Git yet, we’ll
start off by adding another line to <code>hello</code> first:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo &quot;It's a new day for git&quot; &gt;&gt;hello
</code></pre>

<p>and you can now, since you told Git about the previous state of <code>hello</code>,
ask Git what has changed in the tree compared to your old index, using
the <em>git diff-files</em> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff-files
</code></pre>

<p>Oops. That wasn’t very readable. It just spit out its own internal
version of a <em>diff</em>, but that internal version really just tells you
that it has noticed that &ldquo;hello&rdquo; has been modified, and that the old
object contents it had have been replaced with something else.</p>

<p>To make it readable, we can tell <em>git diff-files</em> to output the
differences as a patch, using the <code>-p</code> flag:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff-files -p
diff --git a/hello b/hello
index 557db03..263414f 100644
--- a/hello
+++ b/hello
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 Hello World
+It's a new day for git
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. the diff of the change we caused by adding another line to <code>hello</code>.</p>

<p>In other words, <em>git diff-files</em> always shows us the difference between
what is recorded in the index, and what is currently in the working
tree. That’s very useful.</p>

<p>A common shorthand for <code>git diff-files -p</code> is to just write <code>git diff</code>,
which will do the same thing.</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff
diff --git a/hello b/hello
index 557db03..263414f 100644
--- a/hello
+++ b/hello
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 Hello World
+It's a new day for git
</code></pre>

<h2 id="committing-git-state">Committing Git state</h2>

<p>Now, we want to go to the next stage in Git, which is to take the files
that Git knows about in the index, and commit them as a real tree. We do
that in two phases: creating a <em>tree</em> object, and committing that <em>tree</em>
object as a <em>commit</em> object together with an explanation of what the
tree was all about, along with information of how we came to that state.</p>

<p>Creating a tree object is trivial, and is done with <em>git write-tree</em>.
There are no options or other input: <code>git write-tree</code> will take the
current index state, and write an object that describes that whole
index. In other words, we’re now tying together all the different
filenames with their contents (and their permissions), and we’re
creating the equivalent of a Git &ldquo;directory&rdquo; object:</p>

<pre><code>$ git write-tree
</code></pre>

<p>and this will just output the name of the resulting tree, in this case
(if you have done exactly as I’ve described) it should be</p>

<pre><code>8988da15d077d4829fc51d8544c097def6644dbb
</code></pre>

<p>which is another incomprehensible object name. Again, if you want to,
you can use <code>git cat-file -t 8988d...</code> to see that this time the object
is not a &ldquo;blob&rdquo; object, but a &ldquo;tree&rdquo; object (you can also use <code>git
cat-file</code> to actually output the raw object contents, but you’ll see
mainly a binary mess, so that’s less interesting).</p>

<p>However — normally you’d never use <em>git write-tree</em> on its own, because
normally you always commit a tree into a commit object using the <em>git
commit-tree</em> command. In fact, it’s easier to not actually use <em>git
write-tree</em> on its own at all, but to just pass its result in as an
argument to <em>git commit-tree</em>.</p>

<p><em>git commit-tree</em> normally takes several arguments — it wants to know
what the <em>parent</em> of a commit was, but since this is the first commit
ever in this new repository, and it has no parents, we only need to pass
in the object name of the tree. However, <em>git commit-tree</em> also wants to
get a commit message on its standard input, and it will write out the
resulting object name for the commit to its standard output.</p>

<p>And this is where we create the <code>.git/refs/heads/master</code> file which is
pointed at by <code>HEAD</code>. This file is supposed to contain the reference to
the top-of-tree of the master branch, and since that’s exactly what <em>git
commit-tree</em> spits out, we can do this all with a sequence of simple
shell commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ tree=$(git write-tree)
$ commit=$(echo 'Initial commit' | git commit-tree $tree)
$ git update-ref HEAD $commit
</code></pre>

<p>In this case this creates a totally new commit that is not related to
anything else. Normally you do this only <strong>once</strong> for a project ever,
and all later commits will be parented on top of an earlier commit.</p>

<p>Again, normally you’d never actually do this by hand. There is a helpful
script called <code>git commit</code> that will do all of this for you. So you
could have just written <code>git commit</code> instead, and it would have done the
above magic scripting for you.</p>

<h2 id="making-a-change">Making a change</h2>

<p>Remember how we did the <em>git update-index</em> on file <code>hello</code> and then we
changed <code>hello</code> afterward, and could compare the new state of <code>hello</code>
with the state we saved in the index file?</p>

<p>Further, remember how I said that <em>git write-tree</em> writes the contents
of the <strong>index</strong> file to the tree, and thus what we just committed was
in fact the <strong>original</strong> contents of the file <code>hello</code>, not the new ones.
We did that on purpose, to show the difference between the index state,
and the state in the working tree, and how they don’t have to match,
even when we commit things.</p>

<p>As before, if we do <code>git diff-files -p</code> in our git-tutorial project,
we’ll still see the same difference we saw last time: the index file
hasn’t changed by the act of committing anything. However, now that we
have committed something, we can also learn to use a new command: <em>git
diff-index</em>.</p>

<p>Unlike <em>git diff-files</em>, which showed the difference between the index
file and the working tree, <em>git diff-index</em> shows the differences
between a committed <strong>tree</strong> and either the index file or the working
tree. In other words, <em>git diff-index</em> wants a tree to be diffed
against, and before we did the commit, we couldn’t do that, because we
didn’t have anything to diff against.</p>

<p>But now we can do</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff-index -p HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>(where <code>-p</code> has the same meaning as it did in <em>git diff-files</em>), and it
will show us the same difference, but for a totally different reason.
Now we’re comparing the working tree not against the index file, but
against the tree we just wrote. It just so happens that those two are
obviously the same, so we get the same result.</p>

<p>Again, because this is a common operation, you can also just shorthand
it with</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>which ends up doing the above for you.</p>

<p>In other words, <em>git diff-index</em> normally compares a tree against the
working tree, but when given the <code>--cached</code> flag, it is told to instead
compare against just the index cache contents, and ignore the current
working tree state entirely. Since we just wrote the index file to HEAD,
doing <code>git diff-index --cached -p HEAD</code> should thus return an empty set
of differences, and that’s exactly what it does.</p>

<td><div class="paragraph">
<p><em>git diff-index</em> really always uses the index for its comparisons, and saying that it compares a tree against the working tree is thus not strictly accurate. In particular, the list of files to compare (the &quot;meta-data&quot;) <strong>always</strong> comes from the index file, regardless of whether the <code>--cached</code> flag is used or not. The <code>--cached</code> flag really only determines whether the file <strong>contents</strong> to be compared come from the working tree or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not hard to understand, as soon as you realize that Git simply never knows (or cares) about files that it is not told about explicitly. Git will never go <strong>looking</strong> for files to compare, it expects you to tell it what the files are, and that’s what the index is there for.</p>
</div></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>However, our next step is to commit the <strong>change</strong> we did, and again, to
understand what’s going on, keep in mind the difference between &ldquo;working
tree contents&rdquo;, &ldquo;index file&rdquo; and &ldquo;committed tree&rdquo;. We have changes in
the working tree that we want to commit, and we always have to work
through the index file, so the first thing we need to do is to update
the index cache:</p>

<pre><code>$ git update-index hello
</code></pre>

<p>(note how we didn’t need the <code>--add</code> flag this time, since Git knew
about the file already).</p>

<p>Note what happens to the different <em>git diff-*</em> versions here. After
we’ve updated <code>hello</code> in the index, <code>git diff-files -p</code> now shows no
differences, but <code>git diff-index -p HEAD</code> still <strong>does</strong> show that the
current state is different from the state we committed. In fact, now
<em>git diff-index</em> shows the same difference whether we use the <code>--cached</code>
flag or not, since now the index is coherent with the working tree.</p>

<p>Now, since we’ve updated <code>hello</code> in the index, we can commit the new
version. We could do it by writing the tree by hand again, and
committing the tree (this time we’d have to use the <code>-p HEAD</code> flag to
tell commit that the HEAD was the <strong>parent</strong> of the new commit, and that
this wasn’t an initial commit any more), but you’ve done that once
already, so let’s just use the helpful script this time:</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit
</code></pre>

<p>which starts an editor for you to write the commit message and tells you
a bit about what you have done.</p>

<p>Write whatever message you want, and all the lines that start with <em>#</em>
will be pruned out, and the rest will be used as the commit message for
the change. If you decide you don’t want to commit anything after all at
this point (you can continue to edit things and update the index), you
can just leave an empty message. Otherwise <code>git commit</code> will commit the
change for you.</p>

<p>You’ve now made your first real Git commit. And if you’re interested in
looking at what <code>git commit</code> really does, feel free to investigate: it’s
a few very simple shell scripts to generate the helpful (?) commit
message headers, and a few one-liners that actually do the commit itself
(<em>git commit</em>).</p>

<h2 id="inspecting-changes">Inspecting Changes</h2>

<p>While creating changes is useful, it’s even more useful if you can tell
later what changed. The most useful command for this is another of the
<em>diff</em> family, namely <em>git diff-tree</em>.</p>

<p><em>git diff-tree</em> can be given two arbitrary trees, and it will tell you
the differences between them. Perhaps even more commonly, though, you
can give it just a single commit object, and it will figure out the
parent of that commit itself, and show the difference directly. Thus, to
get the same diff that we’ve already seen several times, we can now do</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff-tree -p HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>(again, <code>-p</code> means to show the difference as a human-readable patch),
and it will show what the last commit (in <code>HEAD</code>) actually changed.</p>

<p>More interestingly, you can also give <em>git diff-tree</em> the <code>--pretty</code>
flag, which tells it to also show the commit message and author and date
of the commit, and you can tell it to show a whole series of diffs.
Alternatively, you can tell it to be &ldquo;silent&rdquo;, and not show the diffs at
all, but just show the actual commit message.</p>

<p>In fact, together with the <em>git rev-list</em> program (which generates a
list of revisions), <em>git diff-tree</em> ends up being a veritable fount of
changes. You can emulate <code>git log</code>, <code>git log -p</code>, etc. with a trivial
script that pipes the output of <code>git rev-list</code> to <code>git diff-tree
--stdin</code>, which was exactly how early versions of <code>git log</code> were
implemented.</p>

<h2 id="tagging-a-version">Tagging a version</h2>

<p>In Git, there are two kinds of tags, a &ldquo;light&rdquo; one, and an &ldquo;annotated
tag&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;light&rdquo; tag is technically nothing more than a branch, except we put
it in the <code>.git/refs/tags/</code> subdirectory instead of calling it a <code>head</code>.
So the simplest form of tag involves nothing more than</p>

<pre><code>$ git tag my-first-tag
</code></pre>

<p>which just writes the current <code>HEAD</code> into the
<code>.git/refs/tags/my-first-tag</code> file, after which point you can then use
this symbolic name for that particular state. You can, for example, do</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff my-first-tag
</code></pre>

<p>to diff your current state against that tag which at this point will
obviously be an empty diff, but if you continue to develop and commit
stuff, you can use your tag as an &ldquo;anchor-point&rdquo; to see what has changed
since you tagged it.</p>

<p>An &ldquo;annotated tag&rdquo; is actually a real Git object, and contains not only
a pointer to the state you want to tag, but also a small tag name and
message, along with optionally a PGP signature that says that yes, you
really did that tag. You create these annotated tags with either the
<code>-a</code> or <code>-s</code> flag to <em>git tag</em>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git tag -s &lt;tagname&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which will sign the current <code>HEAD</code> (but you can also give it another
argument that specifies the thing to tag, e.g., you could have tagged
the current <code>mybranch</code> point by using <code>git tag &lt;tagname&gt; mybranch</code>).</p>

<p>You normally only do signed tags for major releases or things like that,
while the light-weight tags are useful for any marking you want to
do — any time you decide that you want to remember a certain
point, just create a private tag for it, and you have a nice symbolic
name for the state at that point.</p>

<h2 id="copying-repositories">Copying repositories</h2>

<p>Git repositories are normally totally self-sufficient and relocatable.
Unlike CVS, for example, there is no separate notion of &ldquo;repository&rdquo; and
&ldquo;working tree&rdquo;. A Git repository normally <strong>is</strong> the working tree, with
the local Git information hidden in the <code>.git</code> subdirectory. There is
nothing else. What you see is what you got.</p>

<p>This has two implications:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if you grow bored with the tutorial repository you created (or
you’ve made a mistake and want to start all over), you can just do
simple</p>

<pre><code>$ rm -rf git-tutorial
</code></pre>

<p>and it will be gone. There’s no external repository, and there’s no
history outside the project you created.</p></li>

<li><p>if you want to move or duplicate a Git repository, you can do so.
There is <em>git clone</em> command, but if all you want to do is just to
create a copy of your repository (with all the full history that
went along with it), you can do so with a regular <code>cp -a
git-tutorial new-git-tutorial</code>.</p>

<p>Note that when you’ve moved or copied a Git repository, your Git
index file (which caches various information, notably some of the
&ldquo;stat&rdquo; information for the files involved) will likely need to be
refreshed. So after you do a <code>cp -a</code> to create a new copy, you’ll
want to do</p>

<pre><code>$ git update-index --refresh
</code></pre>

<p>in the new repository to make sure that the index file is
up-to-date.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the second point is true even across machines. You can
duplicate a remote Git repository with <strong>any</strong> regular copy mechanism,
be it <em>scp</em>, <em>rsync</em> or <em>wget</em>.</p>

<p>When copying a remote repository, you’ll want to at a minimum update the
index cache when you do this, and especially with other peoples&rsquo;
repositories you often want to make sure that the index cache is in some
known state (you don’t know <strong>what</strong> they’ve done and not yet checked
in), so usually you’ll precede the <em>git update-index</em> with a</p>

<pre><code>$ git read-tree --reset HEAD
$ git update-index --refresh
</code></pre>

<p>which will force a total index re-build from the tree pointed to by
<code>HEAD</code>. It resets the index contents to <code>HEAD</code>, and then the <em>git
update-index</em> makes sure to match up all index entries with the
checked-out files. If the original repository had uncommitted changes in
its working tree, <code>git update-index --refresh</code> notices them and tells
you they need to be updated.</p>

<p>The above can also be written as simply</p>

<pre><code>$ git reset
</code></pre>

<p>and in fact a lot of the common Git command combinations can be scripted
with the <code>git xyz</code> interfaces. You can learn things by just looking at
what the various git scripts do. For example, <code>git reset</code> used to be the
above two lines implemented in <em>git reset</em>, but some things like <em>git
status</em> and <em>git commit</em> are slightly more complex scripts around the
basic Git commands.</p>

<p>Many (most?) public remote repositories will not contain any of the
checked out files or even an index file, and will <strong>only</strong> contain the
actual core Git files. Such a repository usually doesn’t even have the
<code>.git</code> subdirectory, but has all the Git files directly in the
repository.</p>

<p>To create your own local live copy of such a &ldquo;raw&rdquo; Git repository, you’d
first create your own subdirectory for the project, and then copy the
raw repository contents into the <code>.git</code> directory. For example, to
create your own copy of the Git repository, you’d do the following</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir my-git
$ cd my-git
$ rsync -rL rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/ .git
</code></pre>

<p>followed by</p>

<pre><code>$ git read-tree HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>to populate the index. However, now you have populated the index, and
you have all the Git internal files, but you will notice that you don’t
actually have any of the working tree files to work on. To get those,
you’d check them out with</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout-index -u -a
</code></pre>

<p>where the <code>-u</code> flag means that you want the checkout to keep the index
up-to-date (so that you don’t have to refresh it afterward), and the
<code>-a</code> flag means &ldquo;check out all files&rdquo; (if you have a stale copy or an
older version of a checked out tree you may also need to add the <code>-f</code>
flag first, to tell <em>git checkout-index</em> to <strong>force</strong> overwriting of any
old files).</p>

<p>Again, this can all be simplified with</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/ my-git
$ cd my-git
$ git checkout
</code></pre>

<p>which will end up doing all of the above for you.</p>

<p>You have now successfully copied somebody else’s (mine) remote
repository, and checked it out.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-branch">Creating a new branch</h2>

<p>Branches in Git are really nothing more than pointers into the Git
object database from within the <code>.git/refs/</code> subdirectory, and as we
already discussed, the <code>HEAD</code> branch is nothing but a symlink to one of
these object pointers.</p>

<p>You can at any time create a new branch by just picking an arbitrary
point in the project history, and just writing the SHA-1 name of that
object into a file under <code>.git/refs/heads/</code>. You can use any filename
you want (and indeed, subdirectories), but the convention is that the
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; branch is called <code>master</code>. That’s just a convention, though,
and nothing enforces it.</p>

<p>To show that as an example, let’s go back to the git-tutorial repository
we used earlier, and create a branch in it. You do that by simply just
saying that you want to check out a new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b mybranch
</code></pre>

<p>will create a new branch based at the current <code>HEAD</code> position, and
switch to it.</p>

<p>If you make the decision to start your new branch at some other point in the history than the current <code>HEAD</code>, you can do so by just telling <em>git checkout</em> what the base of the checkout would be. In other words, if you have an earlier tag or branch, you’d just do</p>

<p>You can always just jump back to your original <code>master</code> branch by doing</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout master
</code></pre>

<p>(or any other branch-name, for that matter) and if you forget which
branch you happen to be on, a simple</p>

<pre><code>$ cat .git/HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>will tell you where it’s pointing. To get the list of branches you have,
you can say</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch
</code></pre>

<p>which used to be nothing more than a simple script around <code>ls
.git/refs/heads</code>. There will be an asterisk in front of the branch you
are currently on.</p>

<p>Sometimes you may wish to create a new branch <em>without</em> actually
checking it out and switching to it. If so, just use the command</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch &lt;branchname&gt; [startingpoint]
</code></pre>

<p>which will simply <em>create</em> the branch, but will not do anything further.
You can then later — once you decide that you want to actually develop
on that branch — switch to that branch with a regular <em>git checkout</em>
with the branchname as the argument.</p>

<h2 id="merging-two-branches">Merging two branches</h2>

<p>One of the ideas of having a branch is that you do some (possibly
experimental) work in it, and eventually merge it back to the main
branch. So assuming you created the above <code>mybranch</code> that started out
being the same as the original <code>master</code> branch, let’s make sure we’re in
that branch, and do some work there.</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout mybranch
$ echo &quot;Work, work, work&quot; &gt;&gt;hello
$ git commit -m &quot;Some work.&quot; -i hello
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we just added another line to <code>hello</code>, and we used a shorthand for
doing both <code>git update-index hello</code> and <code>git commit</code> by just giving the
filename directly to <code>git commit</code>, with an <code>-i</code> flag (it tells Git to
<em>include</em> that file in addition to what you have done to the index file
so far when making the commit). The <code>-m</code> flag is to give the commit log
message from the command line.</p>

<p>Now, to make it a bit more interesting, let’s assume that somebody else
does some work in the original branch, and simulate that by going back
to the master branch, and editing the same file differently there:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout master
</code></pre>

<p>Here, take a moment to look at the contents of <code>hello</code>, and notice how
they don’t contain the work we just did in <code>mybranch</code> — because that
work hasn’t happened in the <code>master</code> branch at all. Then do</p>

<pre><code>$ echo &quot;Play, play, play&quot; &gt;&gt;hello
$ echo &quot;Lots of fun&quot; &gt;&gt;example
$ git commit -m &quot;Some fun.&quot; -i hello example
</code></pre>

<p>since the master branch is obviously in a much better mood.</p>

<p>Now, you’ve got two branches, and you decide that you want to merge the
work done. Before we do that, let’s introduce a cool graphical tool that
helps you view what’s going on:</p>

<pre><code>$ gitk --all
</code></pre>

<p>will show you graphically both of your branches (that’s what the <code>--all</code>
means: normally it will just show you your current <code>HEAD</code>) and their
histories. You can also see exactly how they came to be from a common
source.</p>

<p>Anyway, let’s exit <em>gitk</em> (<code>^Q</code> or the File menu), and decide that we
want to merge the work we did on the <code>mybranch</code> branch into the <code>master</code>
branch (which is currently our <code>HEAD</code> too). To do that, there’s a nice
script called <em>git merge</em>, which wants to know which branches you want
to resolve and what the merge is all about:</p>

<pre><code>$ git merge -m &quot;Merge work in mybranch&quot; mybranch
</code></pre>

<p>where the first argument is going to be used as the commit message if
the merge can be resolved automatically.</p>

<p>Now, in this case we’ve intentionally created a situation where the
merge will need to be fixed up by hand, though, so Git will do as much
of it as it can automatically (which in this case is just merge the
<code>example</code> file, which had no differences in the <code>mybranch</code> branch), and
say:</p>

<pre><code>        Auto-merging hello
        CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello
        Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
</code></pre>

<p>It tells you that it did an &ldquo;Automatic merge&rdquo;, which failed due to
conflicts in <code>hello</code>.</p>

<p>Not to worry. It left the (trivial) conflict in <code>hello</code> in the same form
you should already be well used to if you’ve ever used CVS, so let’s
just open <code>hello</code> in our editor (whatever that may be), and fix it up
somehow. I’d suggest just making it so that <code>hello</code> contains all four
lines:</p>

<pre><code>Hello World
It's a new day for git
Play, play, play
Work, work, work
</code></pre>

<p>and once you’re happy with your manual merge, just do a</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -i hello
</code></pre>

<p>which will very loudly warn you that you’re now committing a merge
(which is correct, so never mind), and you can write a small merge
message about your adventures in <em>git merge</em>-land.</p>

<p>After you’re done, start up <code>gitk --all</code> to see graphically what the
history looks like. Notice that <code>mybranch</code> still exists, and you can
switch to it, and continue to work with it if you want to. The
<code>mybranch</code> branch will not contain the merge, but next time you merge it
from the <code>master</code> branch, Git will know how you merged it, so you’ll not
have to do <em>that</em> merge again.</p>

<p>Another useful tool, especially if you do not always work in X-Window
environment, is <code>git show-branch</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ git show-branch --topo-order --more=1 master mybranch
* [master] Merge work in mybranch
 ! [mybranch] Some work.
--
-  [master] Merge work in mybranch
*+ [mybranch] Some work.
*  [master^] Some fun.
</code></pre>

<p>The first two lines indicate that it is showing the two branches with
the titles of their top-of-the-tree commits, you are currently on
<code>master</code> branch (notice the asterisk <code>*</code> character), and the first
column for the later output lines is used to show commits contained in
the <code>master</code> branch, and the second column for the <code>mybranch</code> branch.
Three commits are shown along with their titles. All of them have non
blank characters in the first column (<code>*</code> shows an ordinary commit on
the current branch, <code>-</code> is a merge commit), which means they are now
part of the <code>master</code> branch. Only the &ldquo;Some work&rdquo; commit has the plus
<code>+</code> character in the second column, because <code>mybranch</code> has not been
merged to incorporate these commits from the master branch. The string
inside brackets before the commit log message is a short name you can
use to name the commit. In the above example, <em>master</em> and <em>mybranch</em>
are branch heads. <em>master^</em> is the first parent of <em>master</em> branch head.

<p>Now, let’s pretend you are the one who did all the work in <code>mybranch</code>,
and the fruit of your hard work has finally been merged to the <code>master</code>
branch. Let’s go back to <code>mybranch</code>, and run <em>git merge</em> to get the
&ldquo;upstream changes&rdquo; back to your branch.</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout mybranch
$ git merge -m &quot;Merge upstream changes.&quot; master
</code></pre>

<p>This outputs something like this (the actual commit object names would
be different)</p>

<pre><code>Updating from ae3a2da... to a80b4aa....
Fast-forward (no commit created; -m option ignored)
 example | 1 +
 hello   | 1 +
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
</code></pre>

<p>Because your branch did not contain anything more than what had already
been merged into the <code>master</code> branch, the merge operation did not
actually do a merge. Instead, it just updated the top of the tree of
your branch to that of the <code>master</code> branch. This is often called
<em>fast-forward</em> merge.</p>

<p>You can run <code>gitk --all</code> again to see how the commit ancestry looks
like, or run <em>show-branch</em>, which tells you this.</p>

<pre><code>$ git show-branch master mybranch
! [master] Merge work in mybranch
 * [mybranch] Merge work in mybranch
--
-- [master] Merge work in mybranch
</code></pre>

<h2 id="merging-external-work">Merging external work</h2>

<p>It’s usually much more common that you merge with somebody else than
merging with your own branches, so it’s worth pointing out that Git
makes that very easy too, and in fact, it’s not that different from
doing a <em>git merge</em>. In fact, a remote merge ends up being nothing more
than &ldquo;fetch the work from a remote repository into a temporary tag&rdquo;
followed by a <em>git merge</em>.</p>

<p>Fetching from a remote repository is done by, unsurprisingly, <em>git
fetch</em>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch &lt;remote-repository&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>One of the following transports can be used to name the repository to
download from:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rsync<br />
<code>rsync://remote.machine/path/to/repo.git/</code></p>

<p>Rsync transport is usable for both uploading and downloading, but is
completely unaware of what git does, and can produce unexpected
results when you download from the public repository while the
repository owner is uploading into it via <code>rsync</code> transport. Most
notably, it could update the files under <code>refs/</code> which holds the
object name of the topmost commits before uploading the files in
<code>objects/</code> — the downloader would obtain head commit object name
while that object itself is still not available in the repository.
For this reason, it is considered deprecated.</p></li>

<li><p>SSH<br />
<code>remote.machine:/path/to/repo.git/</code> or</p>

<p><code>ssh://remote.machine/path/to/repo.git/</code></p>

<p>This transport can be used for both uploading and downloading, and
requires you to have a log-in privilege over <code>ssh</code> to the remote
machine. It finds out the set of objects the other side lacks by
exchanging the head commits both ends have and transfers (close to)
minimum set of objects. It is by far the most efficient way to
exchange Git objects between repositories.</p></li>

<li><p>Local directory<br />
<code>/path/to/repo.git/</code></p>

<p>This transport is the same as SSH transport but uses <em>sh</em> to run
both ends on the local machine instead of running other end on the
remote machine via <em>ssh</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Git Native<br />
<code>git://remote.machine/path/to/repo.git/</code></p>

<p>This transport was designed for anonymous downloading. Like SSH
transport, it finds out the set of objects the downstream side lacks
and transfers (close to) minimum set of objects.</p></li>

<li><p>HTTP(S)<br />
<code>http://remote.machine/path/to/repo.git/</code></p>

<p>Downloader from http and https URL first obtains the topmost commit
object name from the remote site by looking at the specified refname
under <code>repo.git/refs/</code> directory, and then tries to obtain the
commit object by downloading from <code>repo.git/objects/xx/xxx...</code> using
the object name of that commit object. Then it reads the commit
object to find out its parent commits and the associate tree object;
it repeats this process until it gets all the necessary objects.
Because of this behavior, they are sometimes also called <em>commit
walkers</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>commit walkers</em> are sometimes also called <em>dumb transports</em>,
because they do not require any Git aware smart server like Git
Native transport does. Any stock HTTP server that does not even
support directory index would suffice. But you must prepare your
repository with <em>git update-server-info</em> to help dumb transport
downloaders.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you fetch from the remote repository, you <code>merge</code> that with your
current branch.</p>

<p>However — it’s such a common thing to <code>fetch</code> and then immediately
<code>merge</code>, that it’s called <code>git pull</code>, and you can simply do</p>

<pre><code>$ git pull &lt;remote-repository&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and optionally give a branch-name for the remote end as a second
argument.</p>

<td>You could do without using any branches at all, by keeping as many local repositories as you would like to have branches, and merging between them with <em>git pull</em>, just like you merge between branches. The advantage of this approach is that it lets you keep a set of files for each <code>branch</code> checked out and you may find it easier to switch back and forth if you juggle multiple lines of development simultaneously. Of course, you will pay the price of more disk usage to hold multiple working trees, but disk space is cheap these days.</td>

<p>It is likely that you will be pulling from the same remote repository
from time to time. As a short hand, you can store the remote repository
URL in the local repository’s config file like
    this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config remote.linus.url http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
</code></pre>

<p>and use the &ldquo;linus&rdquo; keyword with <em>git pull</em> instead of the full URL.</p>

<p>Examples.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>git pull linus</code></p></li>

<li><p><code>git pull linus tag v0.99.1</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>the above are equivalent to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>git pull http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/ HEAD</code></p></li>

<li><p><code>git pull http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/ tag v0.99.1</code></p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-does-the-merge-work">How does the merge work?</h2>

<p>We said this tutorial shows what plumbing does to help you cope with the
porcelain that isn’t flushing, but we so far did not talk about how the
merge really works. If you are following this tutorial the first time,
I’d suggest to skip to &ldquo;Publishing your work&rdquo; section and come back
here later.</p>

<p>OK, still with me? To give us an example to look at, let’s go back to
the earlier repository with &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and &ldquo;example&rdquo; file, and bring
ourselves back to the pre-merge state:</p>

<pre><code>$ git show-branch --more=2 master mybranch
! [master] Merge work in mybranch
 * [mybranch] Merge work in mybranch
--
-- [master] Merge work in mybranch
+* [master^2] Some work.
+* [master^] Some fun.
</code></pre>

<p>Remember, before running <em>git merge</em>, our <code>master</code> head was at &ldquo;Some
fun.&rdquo; commit, while our <code>mybranch</code> head was at &ldquo;Some work.&rdquo; commit.</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout mybranch
$ git reset --hard master^2
$ git checkout master
$ git reset --hard master^
</code></pre>

<p>After rewinding, the commit structure should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git show-branch
* [master] Some fun.
 ! [mybranch] Some work.
--
*  [master] Some fun.
 + [mybranch] Some work.
*+ [master^] Initial commit
</code></pre>

<p>Now we are ready to experiment with the merge by hand.</p>

<p><code>git merge</code> command, when merging two branches, uses 3-way merge
algorithm. First, it finds the common ancestor between them. The command
it uses is <em>git merge-base</em>:</p>

<pre><code>$ mb=$(git merge-base HEAD mybranch)
</code></pre>

<p>The command writes the commit object name of the common ancestor to the
standard output, so we captured its output to a variable, because we
will be using it in the next step. By the way, the common ancestor
commit is the &ldquo;Initial commit&rdquo; commit in this case. You can tell it by:</p>

<pre><code>$ git name-rev --name-only --tags $mb
my-first-tag
</code></pre>

<p>After finding out a common ancestor commit, the second step is this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git read-tree -m -u $mb HEAD mybranch
</code></pre>

<p>This is the same <em>git read-tree</em> command we have already seen, but it
takes three trees, unlike previous examples. This reads the contents of
each tree into different <em>stage</em> in the index file (the first tree goes
to stage 1, the second to stage 2, etc.). After reading three trees into
three stages, the paths that are the same in all three stages are
<em>collapsed</em> into stage 0. Also paths that are the same in two of three
stages are collapsed into stage 0, taking the SHA-1 from either stage 2
or stage 3, whichever is different from stage 1 (i.e. only one side
changed from the common ancestor).</p>

<p>After <em>collapsing</em> operation, paths that are different in three trees
are left in non-zero stages. At this point, you can inspect the index
file with this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git ls-files --stage
100644 7f8b141b65fdcee47321e399a2598a235a032422 0       example
100644 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238 1       hello
100644 ba42a2a96e3027f3333e13ede4ccf4498c3ae942 2       hello
100644 cc44c73eb783565da5831b4d820c962954019b69 3       hello
</code></pre>

<p>In our example of only two files, we did not have unchanged files so
only <em>example</em> resulted in collapsing. But in real-life large projects,
when only a small number of files change in one commit, this
<em>collapsing</em> tends to trivially merge most of the paths fairly quickly,
leaving only a handful of real changes in non-zero stages.</p>

<p>To look at only non-zero stages, use <code>--unmerged</code> flag:</p>

<pre><code>$ git ls-files --unmerged
100644 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238 1       hello
100644 ba42a2a96e3027f3333e13ede4ccf4498c3ae942 2       hello
100644 cc44c73eb783565da5831b4d820c962954019b69 3       hello
</code></pre>

<p>The next step of merging is to merge these three versions of the file,
using 3-way merge. This is done by giving <em>git merge-one-file</em> command
as one of the arguments to <em>git merge-index</em> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git merge-index git-merge-one-file hello
Auto-merging hello
ERROR: Merge conflict in hello
fatal: merge program failed
</code></pre>

<p><em>git merge-one-file</em> script is called with parameters to describe those
three versions, and is responsible to leave the merge results in the
working tree. It is a fairly straightforward shell script, and
eventually calls <em>merge</em> program from RCS suite to perform a file-level
3-way merge. In this case, <em>merge</em> detects conflicts, and the merge
result with conflict marks is left in the working tree.. This can be
seen if you run <code>ls-files --stage</code> again at this point:</p>

<pre><code>$ git ls-files --stage
100644 7f8b141b65fdcee47321e399a2598a235a032422 0       example
100644 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238 1       hello
100644 ba42a2a96e3027f3333e13ede4ccf4498c3ae942 2       hello
100644 cc44c73eb783565da5831b4d820c962954019b69 3       hello
</code></pre>

<p>This is the state of the index file and the working file after <em>git
merge</em> returns control back to you, leaving the conflicting merge for
you to resolve. Notice that the path <code>hello</code> is still unmerged, and what
you see with <em>git diff</em> at this point is differences since stage 2 (i.e.
your version).</p>

<h2 id="publishing-your-work">Publishing your work</h2>

<p>So, we can use somebody else’s work from a remote repository, but how
can <strong>you</strong> prepare a repository to let other people pull from it?</p>

<p>You do your real work in your working tree that has your primary
repository hanging under it as its <code>.git</code> subdirectory. You <strong>could</strong>
make that repository accessible remotely and ask people to pull from it,
but in practice that is not the way things are usually done. A
recommended way is to have a public repository, make it reachable by
other people, and when the changes you made in your primary working tree
are in good shape, update the public repository from it. This is often
called <em>pushing</em>.</p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>Publishing the changes from your local (private) repository to your
remote (public) repository requires a write privilege on the remote
machine. You need to have an SSH account there to run a single command,
<em>git-receive-pack</em>.</p>

<p>First, you need to create an empty repository on the remote machine that
will house your public repository. This empty repository will be
populated and be kept up-to-date by pushing into it later. Obviously,
this repository creation needs to be done only once.</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Your private repository’s Git directory is usually <code>.git</code>, but your
public repository is often named after the project name, i.e.
<code>&lt;project&gt;.git</code>. Let’s create such a public repository for project
<code>my-git</code>. After logging into the remote machine, create an empty
directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir my-git.git
</code></pre>

<p>Then, make that directory into a Git repository by running <em>git init</em>,
but this time, since its name is not the usual <code>.git</code>, we do things
slightly differently:</p>

<pre><code>$ GIT_DIR=my-git.git git init
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure this directory is available for others you want your changes
to be pulled via the transport of your choice. Also you need to make
sure that you have the <em>git-receive-pack</em> program on the <code>$PATH</code>.</p>

This makes sure that every time you push into this repository, <code>git update-server-info</code> is run.</td>

<p>Your &ldquo;public repository&rdquo; is now ready to accept your changes. Come back
to the machine you have your private repository. From there, run this
command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push &lt;public-host&gt;:/path/to/my-git.git master
</code></pre>

<p>This synchronizes your public repository to match the named branch head
(i.e. <code>master</code> in this case) and objects reachable from them in your
current repository.</p>

<p>As a real example, this is how I update my public Git repository.
Kernel.org mirror network takes care of the propagation to other
publicly visible machines:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/git/git.git/
</code></pre>

<h2 id="packing-your-repository">Packing your repository</h2>

<p>Earlier, we saw that one file under <code>.git/objects/??/</code> directory is
stored for each Git object you create. This representation is efficient
to create atomically and safely, but not so convenient to transport over
the network. Since Git objects are immutable once they are created,
there is a way to optimize the storage by &ldquo;packing them together&rdquo;. The
command</p>

<pre><code>$ git repack
</code></pre>

<p>will do it for you. If you followed the tutorial examples, you would
have accumulated about 17 objects in <code>.git/objects/??/</code> directories by
now. <em>git repack</em> tells you how many objects it packed, and stores the
packed file in <code>.git/objects/pack</code> directory.</p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><div class="title">
Note
</div></td>
<td>You will see two files, <code>pack-*.pack</code> and <code>pack-*.idx</code>, in <code>.git/objects/pack</code> directory. They are closely related to each other, and if you ever copy them by hand to a different repository for whatever reason, you should make sure you copy them together. The former holds all the data from the objects in the pack, and the latter holds the index for random access.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>If you are paranoid, running <em>git verify-pack</em> command would detect if
you have a corrupt pack, but do not worry too much. Our programs are
always perfect ;-).</p>

<p>Once you have packed objects, you do not need to leave the unpacked
objects that are contained in the pack file anymore.</p>

<pre><code>$ git prune-packed
</code></pre>

<p>would remove them for you.</p>

<p>You can try running <code>find .git/objects -type f</code> before and after you run
<code>git prune-packed</code> if you are curious. Also <code>git count-objects</code> would
tell you how many unpacked objects are in your repository and how much
space they are consuming.</p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><div class="title">
Note
</div></td>
<td><code>git pull</code> is slightly cumbersome for HTTP transport, as a packed repository may contain relatively few objects in a relatively large pack. If you expect many HTTP pulls from your public repository you might want to repack &amp; prune often, or never.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>If you run <code>git repack</code> again at this point, it will say &ldquo;Nothing new to
pack.&ldquo;. Once you continue your development and accumulate the changes,
running <code>git repack</code> again will create a new pack, that contains objects
created since you packed your repository the last time. We recommend
that you pack your project soon after the initial import (unless you are
starting your project from scratch), and then run <code>git repack</code> every
once in a while, depending on how active your project is.</p>

<p>When a repository is synchronized via <code>git push</code> and <code>git pull</code> objects
packed in the source repository are usually stored unpacked in the
destination, unless rsync transport is used. While this allows you to
use different packing strategies on both ends, it also means you may
need to repack both repositories every once in a while.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-others">Working with Others</h2>

<p>Although Git is a truly distributed system, it is often convenient to
organize your project with an informal hierarchy of developers. Linux
kernel development is run this way. There is a nice illustration (page
17, &ldquo;Merges to Mainline&rdquo;) in <a href="http://www.xenotime.net/linux/mentor/linux-mentoring-2006.pdf">Randy Dunlap’s
presentation</a>.</p>

<p>It should be stressed that this hierarchy is purely <strong>informal</strong>. There
is nothing fundamental in Git that enforces the &ldquo;chain of patch flow&rdquo;
this hierarchy implies. You do not have to pull from only one remote
repository.</p>

<p>A recommended workflow for a &ldquo;project lead&rdquo; goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Prepare your primary repository on your local machine. Your work is
done there.</p></li>

<li><p>Prepare a public repository accessible to others.</p>

<p>If other people are pulling from your repository over dumb transport
protocols (HTTP), you need to keep this repository <em>dumb transport
friendly</em>. After <code>git init</code>, <code>$GIT_DIR/hooks/post-update.sample</code>
copied from the standard templates would contain a call to <em>git
update-server-info</em> but you need to manually enable the hook with
<code>mv post-update.sample post-update</code>. This makes sure <em>git
update-server-info</em> keeps the necessary files up-to-date.</p></li>

<li><p>Push into the public repository from your primary repository.</p></li>

<li><p><em>git repack</em> the public repository. This establishes a big pack that
contains the initial set of objects as the baseline, and possibly
<em>git prune</em> if the transport used for pulling from your repository
supports packed repositories.</p></li>

<li><p>Keep working in your primary repository. Your changes include
modifications of your own, patches you receive via e-mails, and
merges resulting from pulling the &ldquo;public&rdquo; repositories of your
&ldquo;subsystem maintainers&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You can repack this private repository whenever you feel like.</p></li>

<li><p>Push your changes to the public repository, and announce it to the
public.</p></li>

<li><p>Every once in a while, <em>git repack</em> the public repository. Go back
to step 5. and continue working.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A recommended work cycle for a &ldquo;subsystem maintainer&rdquo; who works on that
project and has an own &ldquo;public repository&rdquo; goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Prepare your work repository, by <em>git clone</em> the public repository
of the &ldquo;project lead&rdquo;. The URL used for the initial cloning is
stored in the remote.origin.url configuration variable.</p></li>

<li><p>Prepare a public repository accessible to others, just like the
&ldquo;project lead&rdquo; person does.</p></li>

<li><p>Copy over the packed files from &ldquo;project lead&rdquo; public repository to
your public repository, unless the &ldquo;project lead&rdquo; repository lives
on the same machine as yours. In the latter case, you can use
<code>objects/info/alternates</code> file to point at the repository you are
borrowing from.</p></li>

<li><p>Push into the public repository from your primary repository. Run
<em>git repack</em>, and possibly <em>git prune</em> if the transport used for
pulling from your repository supports packed repositories.</p></li>

<li><p>Keep working in your primary repository. Your changes include
modifications of your own, patches you receive via e-mails, and
merges resulting from pulling the &ldquo;public&rdquo; repositories of your
&ldquo;project lead&rdquo; and possibly your &ldquo;sub-subsystem maintainers&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You can repack this private repository whenever you feel like.</p></li>

<li><p>Push your changes to your public repository, and ask your &ldquo;project
lead&rdquo; and possibly your &ldquo;sub-subsystem maintainers&rdquo; to pull from it.</p></li>

<li><p>Every once in a while, <em>git repack</em> the public repository. Go back
to step 5. and continue working.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A recommended work cycle for an &ldquo;individual developer&rdquo; who does not have
a &ldquo;public&rdquo; repository is somewhat different. It goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Prepare your work repository, by <em>git clone</em> the public repository
of the &ldquo;project lead&rdquo; (or a &ldquo;subsystem maintainer&rdquo;, if you work on a
subsystem). The URL used for the initial cloning is stored in the
remote.origin.url configuration variable.</p></li>

<li><p>Do your work in your repository on <em>master</em> branch.</p></li>

<li><p>Run <code>git fetch origin</code> from the public repository of your upstream
every once in a while. This does only the first half of <code>git pull</code>
but does not merge. The head of the public repository is stored in
<code>.git/refs/remotes/origin/master</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Use <code>git cherry origin</code> to see which ones of your patches were
accepted, and/or use <code>git rebase origin</code> to port your unmerged
changes forward to the updated upstream.</p></li>

<li><p>Use <code>git format-patch origin</code> to prepare patches for e-mail
submission to your upstream and send it out. Go back to step 2. and
continue.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="working-with-others-shared-repository-style">Working with Others, Shared Repository Style</h2>

<p>If you are coming from CVS background, the style of cooperation
suggested in the previous section may be new to you. You do not have to
worry. Git supports &ldquo;shared public repository&rdquo; style of cooperation you
are probably more familiar with as well.</p>

<p>See <a href="../gitcvs-migration">gitcvs-migration(7)</a> for the details.</p>

<h2 id="bundling-your-work-together">Bundling your work together</h2>

<p>It is likely that you will be working on more than one thing at a time.
It is easy to manage those more-or-less independent tasks using branches
with Git.</p>

<p>We have already seen how branches work previously, with &ldquo;fun and work&rdquo;
example using two branches. The idea is the same if there are more than
two branches. Let’s say you started out from &ldquo;master&rdquo; head, and have
some new code in the &ldquo;master&rdquo; branch, and two independent fixes in the
&ldquo;commit-fix&rdquo; and &ldquo;diff-fix&rdquo; branches:</p>

<pre><code>$ git show-branch
! [commit-fix] Fix commit message normalization.
 ! [diff-fix] Fix rename detection.
  * [master] Release candidate #1
---
 +  [diff-fix] Fix rename detection.
 +  [diff-fix~1] Better common substring algorithm.
+   [commit-fix] Fix commit message normalization.
  * [master] Release candidate #1
++* [diff-fix~2] Pretty-print messages.
</code></pre>

<p>Both fixes are tested well, and at this point, you want to merge in both
of them. You could merge in <em>diff-fix</em> first and then <em>commit-fix</em> next,
like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git merge -m &quot;Merge fix in diff-fix&quot; diff-fix
$ git merge -m &quot;Merge fix in commit-fix&quot; commit-fix
</code></pre>

<p>Which would result in:</p>

<pre><code>$ git show-branch
! [commit-fix] Fix commit message normalization.
 ! [diff-fix] Fix rename detection.
  * [master] Merge fix in commit-fix
---
  - [master] Merge fix in commit-fix
+ * [commit-fix] Fix commit message normalization.
  - [master~1] Merge fix in diff-fix
 +* [diff-fix] Fix rename detection.
 +* [diff-fix~1] Better common substring algorithm.
  * [master~2] Release candidate #1
++* [master~3] Pretty-print messages.
</code></pre>

<p>However, there is no particular reason to merge in one branch first and
the other next, when what you have are a set of truly independent
changes (if the order mattered, then they are not independent by
definition). You could instead merge those two branches into the current
branch at once. First let’s undo what we just did and start over. We
would want to get the master branch before these two merges by resetting
it to <em>master~2</em>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git reset --hard master~2
</code></pre>

<p>You can make sure <code>git show-branch</code> matches the state before those two
<em>git merge</em> you just did. Then, instead of running two <em>git merge</em>
commands in a row, you would merge these two branch heads (this is known
as <em>making an Octopus</em>):</p>

<pre><code>$ git merge commit-fix diff-fix
$ git show-branch
! [commit-fix] Fix commit message normalization.
 ! [diff-fix] Fix rename detection.
  * [master] Octopus merge of branches 'diff-fix' and 'commit-fix'
---
  - [master] Octopus merge of branches 'diff-fix' and 'commit-fix'
+ * [commit-fix] Fix commit message normalization.
 +* [diff-fix] Fix rename detection.
 +* [diff-fix~1] Better common substring algorithm.
  * [master~1] Release candidate #1
++* [master~2] Pretty-print messages.
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you should not do Octopus because you can. An octopus is a
valid thing to do and often makes it easier to view the commit history
if you are merging more than two independent changes at the same time.
However, if you have merge conflicts with any of the branches you are
merging in and need to hand resolve, that is an indication that the
development happened in those branches were not independent after all,
and you should merge two at a time, documenting how you resolved the
conflicts, and the reason why you preferred changes made in one side
over the other. Otherwise it would make the project history harder to
follow, not easier.</p>
