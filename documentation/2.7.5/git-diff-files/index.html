<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<pre><code>git diff-files [-q] [-0|-1|-2|-3|-c|--cc] [&lt;common diff options&gt;] [&lt;path&gt;…]
</code></pre>

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>Compares the files in the working tree and the index. When paths are
specified, compares only those named paths. Otherwise all entries in the
index are compared. The output format is the same as for <em>git
diff-index</em> and <em>git diff-tree</em>.</p>

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>-p<br />
-u<br />
&ndash;patch<br />
Generate patch (see section on generating patches).</p>

<p>-s<br />
&ndash;no-patch<br />
Suppress diff output. Useful for commands like <code>git show</code> that show the
patch by default, or to cancel the effect of <code>--patch</code>.</p>

<p>-U&lt;n&gt;<br />
&ndash;unified=&lt;n&gt;<br />
Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of the usual
three. Implies <code>-p</code>.</p>

<p>&ndash;raw<br />
Generate the diff in raw format. This is the default.</p>

<p>&ndash;patch-with-raw<br />
Synonym for <code>-p --raw</code>.</p>

<p>&ndash;minimal<br />
Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is produced.</p>

<p>&ndash;patience<br />
Generate a diff using the &ldquo;patience diff&rdquo; algorithm.</p>

<p>&ndash;histogram<br />
Generate a diff using the &ldquo;histogram diff&rdquo; algorithm.</p>

<p>&ndash;diff-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}<br />
Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:</p>

<p><code>default</code>, <code>myers</code><br />
The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the default.</p>

<p><code>minimal</code><br />
Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is produced.</p>

<p><code>patience</code><br />
Use &ldquo;patience diff&rdquo; algorithm when generating patches.</p>

<p><code>histogram</code><br />
This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to &ldquo;support low-occurrence
common elements&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For instance, if you configured diff.algorithm variable to a non-default
value and want to use the default one, then you have to use
<code>--diff-algorithm=default</code> option.</p>

<p>&ndash;stat[=&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;name-width&gt;[,&lt;count&gt;]]]<br />
Generate a diffstat. By default, as much space as necessary will be used
for the filename part, and the rest for the graph part. Maximum width
defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns if not connected to a
terminal, and can be overridden by <code>&lt;width&gt;</code>. The width of the filename
part can be limited by giving another width <code>&lt;name-width&gt;</code> after a
comma. The width of the graph part can be limited by using
<code>--stat-graph-width=&lt;width&gt;</code> (affects all commands generating a stat
graph) or by setting <code>diff.statGraphWidth=&lt;width&gt;</code> (does not affect
<code>git format-patch</code>). By giving a third parameter <code>&lt;count&gt;</code>, you can
limit the output to the first <code>&lt;count&gt;</code> lines, followed by <code>...</code> if
there are more.</p>

<p>These parameters can also be set individually with
<code>--stat-width=&lt;width&gt;</code>, <code>--stat-name-width=&lt;name-width&gt;</code> and
<code>--stat-count=&lt;count&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>&ndash;numstat<br />
Similar to <code>--stat</code>, but shows number of added and deleted lines in
decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make it more
machine friendly. For binary files, outputs two <code>-</code> instead of saying
<code>0 0</code>.</p>

<p>&ndash;shortstat<br />
Output only the last line of the <code>--stat</code> format containing total number
of modified files, as well as number of added and deleted lines.</p>

<p>&ndash;dirstat[=&lt;param1,param2,…&gt;]<br />
Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for each
sub-directory. The behavior of <code>--dirstat</code> can be customized by passing
it a comma separated list of parameters. The defaults are controlled by
the <code>diff.dirstat</code> configuration variable (see
<a href="../git-config">git-config(1)</a>). The following parameters are
available:</p>

<p><code>changes</code><br />
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been removed
from the source, or added to the destination. This ignores the amount of
pure code movements within a file. In other words, rearranging lines in
a file is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
behavior when no parameter is given.</p>

<p><code>lines</code><br />
Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based diff
analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For binary files,
count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural concept
of lines). This is a more expensive <code>--dirstat</code> behavior than the
<code>changes</code> behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as
much as other changes. The resulting output is consistent with what you
get from the other <code>--*stat</code> options.</p>

<p><code>files</code><br />
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed.
Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This is the
computationally cheapest <code>--dirstat</code> behavior, since it does not have to
look at the file contents at all.</p>

<p><code>cumulative</code><br />
Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as well.
Note that when using <code>cumulative</code>, the sum of the percentages reported
may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior can be specified
with the <code>noncumulative</code> parameter.</p>

<p>&lt;limit&gt;<br />
An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by default).
Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes are
not shown in the output.</p>

<p>Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
<code>--dirstat=files,10,cumulative</code>.</p>

<p>&ndash;summary<br />
Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as
creations, renames and mode changes.</p>

<p>&ndash;patch-with-stat<br />
Synonym for <code>-p --stat</code>.</p>

<p>-z<br />
When <code>--raw</code>, <code>--numstat</code>, <code>--name-only</code> or <code>--name-status</code> has been
given, do not munge pathnames and use NULs as output field terminators.</p>

<p>Without this option, each pathname output will have TAB, LF, double
quotes, and backslash characters replaced with <code>\t</code>, <code>\n</code>, <code>\&quot;</code>, and
<code>\\</code>, respectively, and the pathname will be enclosed in double quotes
if any of those replacements occurred.</p>

<p>&ndash;name-only<br />
Show only names of changed files.</p>

<p>&ndash;name-status<br />
Show only names and status of changed files. See the description of the
<code>--diff-filter</code> option on what the status letters mean.</p>

<p>&ndash;submodule[=&lt;format&gt;]<br />
Specify how differences in submodules are shown. When <code>--submodule</code> or
<code>--submodule=log</code> is given, the <em>log</em> format is used. This format lists
the commits in the range like <a href="../git-submodule">git-submodule(1)</a>
<code>summary</code> does. Omitting the <code>--submodule</code> option or specifying
<code>--submodule=short</code>, uses the <em>short</em> format. This format just shows the
names of the commits at the beginning and end of the range. Can be
tweaked via the <code>diff.submodule</code> configuration variable.</p>

<p>&ndash;color[=&lt;when&gt;]<br />
Show colored diff. <code>--color</code> (i.e. without <em>=&lt;when&gt;</em>) is the same
as <code>--color=always</code>. <em>&lt;when&gt;</em> can be one of <code>always</code>, <code>never</code>, or
<code>auto</code>.</p>

<p>&ndash;no-color<br />
Turn off colored diff. It is the same as <code>--color=never</code>.</p>

<p>&ndash;word-diff[=&lt;mode&gt;]<br />
Show a word diff, using the &lt;mode&gt; to delimit changed words. By
default, words are delimited by whitespace; see <code>--word-diff-regex</code>
below. The &lt;mode&gt; defaults to <em>plain</em>, and must be one of:</p>

<p>color<br />
Highlight changed words using only colors. Implies <code>--color</code>.</p>

<p>plain<br />
Show words as <code>[-removed-]</code> and <code>{+added+}</code>. Makes no attempts to escape
the delimiters if they appear in the input, so the output may be
ambiguous.</p>

<p>porcelain<br />
Use a special line-based format intended for script consumption.
Added/removed/unchanged runs are printed in the usual unified diff
format, starting with a <code>+</code>/<code>-</code>/` ` character at the beginning of the
line and extending to the end of the line. Newlines in the input are
represented by a tilde <code>~</code> on a line of its own.</p>

<p>none<br />
Disable word diff again.</p>

<p>Note that despite the name of the first mode, color is used to highlight
the changed parts in all modes if enabled.</p>

<p>&ndash;word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;<br />
Use &lt;regex&gt; to decide what a word is, instead of considering runs
of non-whitespace to be a word. Also implies <code>--word-diff</code> unless it was
already enabled.</p>

<p>Every non-overlapping match of the &lt;regex&gt; is considered a word.
Anything between these matches is considered whitespace and ignored(!)
for the purposes of finding differences. You may want to append
<code>|[^[:space:]]</code> to your regular expression to make sure that it matches
all non-whitespace characters. A match that contains a newline is
silently truncated(!) at the newline.</p>

<p>For example, <code>--word-diff-regex=.</code> will treat each character as a word
and, correspondingly, show differences character by character.</p>

<p>The regex can also be set via a diff driver or configuration option, see
<a href="../gitattributes">gitattributes(1)</a> or
<a href="../git-config">git-config(1)</a>. Giving it explicitly overrides any
diff driver or configuration setting. Diff drivers override
configuration settings.</p>

<p>&ndash;color-words[=&lt;regex&gt;]<br />
Equivalent to <code>--word-diff=color</code> plus (if a regex was specified)
<code>--word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>&ndash;no-renames<br />
Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration file gives the
default to do so.</p>

<p>&ndash;check<br />
Warn if changes introduce whitespace errors. What are considered
whitespace errors is controlled by <code>core.whitespace</code> configuration. By
default, trailing whitespaces (including lines that solely consist of
whitespaces) and a space character that is immediately followed by a tab
character inside the initial indent of the line are considered
whitespace errors. Exits with non-zero status if problems are found. Not
compatible with &ndash;exit-code.</p>

<p>&ndash;ws-error-highlight=&lt;kind&gt;<br />
Highlight whitespace errors on lines specified by &lt;kind&gt; in the
color specified by <code>color.diff.whitespace</code>. &lt;kind&gt; is a comma
separated list of <code>old</code>, <code>new</code>, <code>context</code>. When this option is not
given, only whitespace errors in <code>new</code> lines are highlighted. E.g.
<code>--ws-error-highlight=new,old</code> highlights whitespace errors on both
deleted and added lines. <code>all</code> can be used as a short-hand for
<code>old,new,context</code>.</p>

<p>&ndash;full-index<br />
Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full pre- and
post-image blob object names on the &ldquo;index&rdquo; line when generating patch
format output.</p>

<p>&ndash;binary<br />
In addition to <code>--full-index</code>, output a binary diff that can be applied
with <code>git-apply</code>.</p>

<p>&ndash;abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]<br />
Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object name in diff-raw
format output and diff-tree header lines, show only a partial prefix.
This is independent of the <code>--full-index</code> option above, which controls
the diff-patch output format. Non default number of digits can be
specified with <code>--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>-B[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]<br />
&ndash;break-rewrites[=[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]]<br />
Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create. This
serves two purposes:</p>

<p>It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file
not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few
lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single
deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything
new, and the number <code>m</code> controls this aspect of the -B option (defaults
to 60%). <code>-B/70%</code> specifies that less than 30% of the original should
remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i.e.
otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion
mixed together with context lines).</p>

<p>When used with -M, a totally-rewritten file is also considered as the
source of a rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared as
the source of a rename), and the number <code>n</code> controls this aspect of the
-B option (defaults to 50%). <code>-B20%</code> specifies that a change with
addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file’s size are
eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another
file.</p>

<p>-M[&lt;n&gt;]<br />
&ndash;find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]<br />
Detect renames. If <code>n</code> is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity
index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file’s size).
For example, <code>-M90%</code> means Git should consider a delete/add pair to be a
rename if more than 90% of the file hasn’t changed. Without a <code>%</code> sign,
the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it.
I.e., <code>-M5</code> becomes 0.5, and is thus the same as <code>-M50%</code>. Similarly,
<code>-M05</code> is the same as <code>-M5%</code>. To limit detection to exact renames, use
<code>-M100%</code>. The default similarity index is 50%.</p>

<p>-C[&lt;n&gt;]<br />
&ndash;find-copies[=&lt;n&gt;]<br />
Detect copies as well as renames. See also <code>--find-copies-harder</code>. If
<code>n</code> is specified, it has the same meaning as for <code>-M&lt;n&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>&ndash;find-copies-harder<br />
For performance reasons, by default, <code>-C</code> option finds copies only if
the original file of the copy was modified in the same changeset. This
flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates for the
source of copy. This is a very expensive operation for large projects,
so use it with caution. Giving more than one <code>-C</code> option has the same
effect.</p>

<p>-D<br />
&ndash;irreversible-delete<br />
Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header but not the
diff between the preimage and <code>/dev/null</code>. The resulting patch is not
meant to be applied with <code>patch</code> or <code>git apply</code>; this is solely for
people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text after the
change. In addition, the output obviously lack enough information to
apply such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of the
option.</p>

<p>When used together with <code>-B</code>, omit also the preimage in the deletion
part of a delete/create pair.</p>

<p>-l&lt;num&gt;<br />
The <code>-M</code> and <code>-C</code> options require O(n^2) processing time where n is the
number of potential rename/copy targets. This option prevents
rename/copy detection from running if the number of rename/copy targets
exceeds the specified number.</p>

<p>&ndash;diff-filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)…[*]]<br />
Select only files that are Added (<code>A</code>), Copied (<code>C</code>), Deleted (<code>D</code>),
Modified (<code>M</code>), Renamed (<code>R</code>), have their type (i.e. regular file,
symlink, submodule, …) changed (<code>T</code>), are Unmerged (<code>U</code>), are Unknown
(<code>X</code>), or have had their pairing Broken (<code>B</code>). Any combination of the
filter characters (including none) can be used. When <code>*</code> (All-or-none)
is added to the combination, all paths are selected if there is any file
that matches other criteria in the comparison; if there is no file that
matches other criteria, nothing is selected.</p>

<p>-S&lt;string&gt;<br />
Look for differences that change the number of occurrences of the
specified string (i.e. addition/deletion) in a file. Intended for the
scripter’s use.</p>

<p>It is useful when you’re looking for an exact block of code (like a
struct), and want to know the history of that block since it first came
into being: use the feature iteratively to feed the interesting block in
the preimage back into <code>-S</code>, and keep going until you get the very first
version of the block.</p>

<p>-G&lt;regex&gt;<br />
Look for differences whose patch text contains added/removed lines that
match &lt;regex&gt;.</p>

<p>To illustrate the difference between <code>-S&lt;regex&gt; --pickaxe-regex</code> and
<code>-G&lt;regex&gt;</code>, consider a commit with the following diff in the same file:</p>

<pre><code>+    return !regexec(regexp, two-&gt;ptr, 1, &amp;regmatch, 0);
...
-    hit = !regexec(regexp, mf2.ptr, 1, &amp;regmatch, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>While <code>git log -G&quot;regexec\(regexp&quot;</code> will show this commit,
<code>git log                     -S&quot;regexec\(regexp&quot; --pickaxe-regex</code> will
not (because the number of occurrences of that string did not change).</p>

<p>See the <em>pickaxe</em> entry in <a href="../gitdiffcore">gitdiffcore(7)</a> for more
information.</p>

<p>&ndash;pickaxe-all<br />
When <code>-S</code> or <code>-G</code> finds a change, show all the changes in that
changeset, not just the files that contain the change in &lt;string&gt;.</p>

<p>&ndash;pickaxe-regex<br />
Treat the &lt;string&gt; given to <code>-S</code> as an extended POSIX regular
expression to match.</p>

<p>-O&lt;orderfile&gt;<br />
Output the patch in the order specified in the &lt;orderfile&gt;, which
has one shell glob pattern per line. This overrides the <code>diff.orderFile</code>
configuration variable (see <a href="../git-config">git-config(1)</a>). To cancel
<code>diff.orderFile</code>, use <code>-O/dev/null</code>.</p>

<p>-R<br />
Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or on-disk file to
tree contents.</p>

<p>&ndash;relative[=&lt;path&gt;]<br />
When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be told to exclude
changes outside the directory and show pathnames relative to it with
this option. When you are not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a bare
repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the output relative
to by giving a &lt;path&gt; as an argument.</p>

<p>-a<br />
&ndash;text<br />
Treat all files as text.</p>

<p>&ndash;ignore-space-at-eol<br />
Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.</p>

<p>-b<br />
&ndash;ignore-space-change<br />
Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores whitespace at line
end, and considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace
characters to be equivalent.</p>

<p>-w<br />
&ndash;ignore-all-space<br />
Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores differences even if
one line has whitespace where the other line has none.</p>

<p>&ndash;ignore-blank-lines<br />
Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.</p>

<p>&ndash;inter-hunk-context=&lt;lines&gt;<br />
Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified number of
lines, thereby fusing hunks that are close to each other.</p>

<p>-W<br />
&ndash;function-context<br />
Show whole surrounding functions of changes.</p>

<p>&ndash;exit-code<br />
Make the program exit with codes similar to diff(1). That is, it exits
with 1 if there were differences and 0 means no differences.</p>

<p>&ndash;quiet<br />
Disable all output of the program. Implies <code>--exit-code</code>.</p>

<p>&ndash;ext-diff<br />
Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set an external
diff driver with <a href="../gitattributes">gitattributes(5)</a>, you need to use
this option with <a href="../git-log">git-log(1)</a> and friends.</p>

<p>&ndash;no-ext-diff<br />
Disallow external diff drivers.</p>

<p>&ndash;textconv<br />
&ndash;no-textconv<br />
Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to be run when
comparing binary files. See <a href="../gitattributes">gitattributes(5)</a> for
details. Because textconv filters are typically a one-way conversion,
the resulting diff is suitable for human consumption, but cannot be
applied. For this reason, textconv filters are enabled by default only
for <a href="../git-diff">git-diff(1)</a> and <a href="../git-log">git-log(1)</a>, but not
for <a href="../git-format-patch">git-format-patch(1)</a> or diff plumbing
commands.</p>

<p>&ndash;ignore-submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]<br />
Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation. &lt;when&gt; can be
either &ldquo;none&rdquo;, &ldquo;untracked&rdquo;, &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; or &ldquo;all&rdquo;, which is the default.
Using &ldquo;none&rdquo; will consider the submodule modified when it either
contains untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit
recorded in the superproject and can be used to override any settings of
the <em>ignore</em> option in <a href="../git-config">git-config(1)</a> or
<a href="../gitmodules">gitmodules(5)</a>. When &ldquo;untracked&rdquo; is used submodules
are not considered dirty when they only contain untracked content (but
they are still scanned for modified content). Using &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; ignores all
changes to the work tree of submodules, only changes to the commits
stored in the superproject are shown (this was the behavior until
1.7.0). Using &ldquo;all&rdquo; hides all changes to submodules.</p>

<p>&ndash;src-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;<br />
Show the given source prefix instead of &ldquo;a/&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ndash;dst-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;<br />
Show the given destination prefix instead of &ldquo;b/&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ndash;no-prefix<br />
Do not show any source or destination prefix.</p>

<p>For more detailed explanation on these common options, see also
<a href="../gitdiffcore">gitdiffcore(7)</a>.</p>

<p>-1 &ndash;base<br />
-2 &ndash;ours<br />
-3 &ndash;theirs<br />
-0<br />
Diff against the &ldquo;base&rdquo; version, &ldquo;our branch&rdquo; or &ldquo;their branch&rdquo;
respectively. With these options, diffs for merged entries are not
shown.</p>

<p>The default is to diff against our branch (-2) and the cleanly resolved
paths. The option -0 can be given to omit diff output for unmerged
entries and just show &ldquo;Unmerged&rdquo;.</p>

<p>-c<br />
&ndash;cc<br />
This compares stage 2 (our branch), stage 3 (their branch) and the
working tree file and outputs a combined diff, similar to the way
<em>diff-tree</em> shows a merge commit with these flags.</p>

<p>-q<br />
Remain silent even on nonexistent files</p>

<h2 id="raw-output-format">Raw output format</h2>

<p>The raw output format from &ldquo;git-diff-index&rdquo;, &ldquo;git-diff-tree&rdquo;,
&ldquo;git-diff-files&rdquo; and &ldquo;git diff &ndash;raw&rdquo; are very similar.</p>

<p>These commands all compare two sets of things; what is compared differs:</p>

<p>git-diff-index &lt;tree-ish&gt;<br />
compares the &lt;tree-ish&gt; and the files on the filesystem.</p>

<p>git-diff-index &ndash;cached &lt;tree-ish&gt;<br />
compares the &lt;tree-ish&gt; and the index.</p>

<p>git-diff-tree [-r] &lt;tree-ish-1&gt; &lt;tree-ish-2&gt; [&lt;pattern&gt;…]<br />
compares the trees named by the two arguments.</p>

<p>git-diff-files [&lt;pattern&gt;…]<br />
compares the index and the files on the filesystem.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;git-diff-tree&rdquo; command begins its output by printing the hash of
what is being compared. After that, all the commands print one output
line per changed file.</p>

<p>An output line is formatted this way:</p>

<pre><code>in-place edit  :100644 100644 bcd1234... 0123456... M file0
copy-edit      :100644 100644 abcd123... 1234567... C68 file1 file2
rename-edit    :100644 100644 abcd123... 1234567... R86 file1 file3
create         :000000 100644 0000000... 1234567... A file4
delete         :100644 000000 1234567... 0000000... D file5
unmerged       :000000 000000 0000000... 0000000... U file6
</code></pre>

<p>That is, from the left to the right:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>a colon.</p></li>

<li><p>mode for &ldquo;src&rdquo;; 000000 if creation or unmerged.</p></li>

<li><p>a space.</p></li>

<li><p>mode for &ldquo;dst&rdquo;; 000000 if deletion or unmerged.</p></li>

<li><p>a space.</p></li>

<li><p>sha1 for &ldquo;src&rdquo;; 0{40} if creation or unmerged.</p></li>

<li><p>a space.</p></li>

<li><p>sha1 for &ldquo;dst&rdquo;; 0{40} if creation, unmerged or &ldquo;look at work tree&rdquo;.</p></li>

<li><p>a space.</p></li>

<li><p>status, followed by optional &ldquo;score&rdquo; number.</p></li>

<li><p>a tab or a NUL when <em>-z</em> option is used.</p></li>

<li><p>path for &ldquo;src&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>a tab or a NUL when <em>-z</em> option is used; only exists for C or R.</p></li>

<li><p>path for &ldquo;dst&rdquo;; only exists for C or R.</p></li>

<li><p>an LF or a NUL when <em>-z</em> option is used, to terminate the record.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Possible status letters are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A: addition of a file</p></li>

<li><p>C: copy of a file into a new one</p></li>

<li><p>D: deletion of a file</p></li>

<li><p>M: modification of the contents or mode of a file</p></li>

<li><p>R: renaming of a file</p></li>

<li><p>T: change in the type of the file</p></li>

<li><p>U: file is unmerged (you must complete the merge before it can be
committed)</p></li>

<li><p>X: &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; change type (most probably a bug, please report it)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Status letters C and R are always followed by a score (denoting the
percentage of similarity between the source and target of the move or
copy). Status letter M may be followed by a score (denoting the
percentage of dissimilarity) for file rewrites.</p>

<p>&lt;sha1&gt; is shown as all 0’s if a file is new on the filesystem and
it is out of sync with the index.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>:100644 100644 5be4a4...... 000000...... M file.c
</code></pre>

<p>When <code>-z</code> option is not used, TAB, LF, and backslash characters in
pathnames are represented as <code>\t</code>, <code>\n</code>, and <code>\\</code>, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="diff-format-for-merges">diff format for merges</h2>

<p>&ldquo;git-diff-tree&rdquo;, &ldquo;git-diff-files&rdquo; and &ldquo;git-diff &ndash;raw&rdquo; can take <em>-c</em> or
<em>&ndash;cc</em> option to generate diff output also for merge commits. The output
differs from the format described above in the following way:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>there is a colon for each parent</p></li>

<li><p>there are more &ldquo;src&rdquo; modes and &ldquo;src&rdquo; sha1</p></li>

<li><p>status is concatenated status characters for each parent</p></li>

<li><p>no optional &ldquo;score&rdquo; number</p></li>

<li><p>single path, only for &ldquo;dst&rdquo;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>::100644 100644 100644 fabadb8... cc95eb0... 4866510... MM      describe.c
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <em>combined diff</em> lists only files which were modified from all
parents.</p>

<h2 id="generating-patches-with-p">Generating patches with -p</h2>

<p>When &ldquo;git-diff-index&rdquo;, &ldquo;git-diff-tree&rdquo;, or &ldquo;git-diff-files&rdquo; are run with
a <em>-p</em> option, &ldquo;git diff&rdquo; without the <em>&ndash;raw</em> option, or &ldquo;git log&rdquo; with
the &ldquo;-p&rdquo; option, they do not produce the output described above; instead
they produce a patch file. You can customize the creation of such
patches via the GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF and the GIT_DIFF_OPTS environment
variables.</p>

<p>What the -p option produces is slightly different from the traditional
diff format:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is preceded with a &ldquo;git diff&rdquo; header that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>diff --git a/file1 b/file2
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>a/</code> and <code>b/</code> filenames are the same unless rename/copy is
involved. Especially, even for a creation or a deletion, <code>/dev/null</code>
is <em>not</em> used in place of the <code>a/</code> or <code>b/</code> filenames.</p>

<p>When rename/copy is involved, <code>file1</code> and <code>file2</code> show the name of
the source file of the rename/copy and the name of the file that
rename/copy produces, respectively.</p></li>

<li><p>It is followed by one or more extended header lines:</p>

<pre><code>old mode &lt;mode&gt;
new mode &lt;mode&gt;
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;
new file mode &lt;mode&gt;
copy from &lt;path&gt;
copy to &lt;path&gt;
rename from &lt;path&gt;
rename to &lt;path&gt;
similarity index &lt;number&gt;
dissimilarity index &lt;number&gt;
index &lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; &lt;mode&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>File modes are printed as 6-digit octal numbers including the file
type and file permission bits.</p>

<p>Path names in extended headers do not include the <code>a/</code> and <code>b/</code>
prefixes.</p>

<p>The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and the
dissimilarity index is the percentage of changed lines. It is a
rounded down integer, followed by a percent sign. The similarity
index value of 100% is thus reserved for two equal files, while 100%
dissimilarity means that no line from the old file made it into the
new one.</p>

<p>The index line includes the SHA-1 checksum before and after the
change. The &lt;mode&gt; is included if the file mode does not
change; otherwise, separate lines indicate the old and the new mode.</p></li>

<li><p>TAB, LF, double quote and backslash characters in pathnames are
represented as <code>\t</code>, <code>\n</code>, <code>\&quot;</code> and <code>\\</code>, respectively. If there is
need for such substitution then the whole pathname is put in double
quotes.</p></li>

<li><p>All the <code>file1</code> files in the output refer to files before the
commit, and all the <code>file2</code> files refer to files after the commit.
It is incorrect to apply each change to each file sequentially. For
example, this patch will swap a and b:</p>

<pre><code>diff --git a/a b/b
rename from a
rename to b
diff --git a/b b/a
rename from b
rename to a
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="combined-diff-format">combined diff format</h2>

<p>Any diff-generating command can take the <code>-c</code> or <code>--cc</code> option to
produce a <em>combined diff</em> when showing a merge. This is the default
format when showing merges with <a href="../git-diff">git-diff(1)</a> or
<a href="../git-show">git-show(1)</a>. Note also that you can give the <code>-m</code>
option to any of these commands to force generation of diffs with
individual parents of a merge.</p>

<p>A <em>combined diff</em> format looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>diff --combined describe.c
index fabadb8,cc95eb0..4866510
--- a/describe.c
+++ b/describe.c
@@@ -98,20 -98,12 +98,20 @@@
        return (a_date &gt; b_date) ? -1 : (a_date == b_date) ? 0 : 1;
  }

- static void describe(char *arg)
 -static void describe(struct commit *cmit, int last_one)
++static void describe(char *arg, int last_one)
  {
 +      unsigned char sha1[20];
 +      struct commit *cmit;
        struct commit_list *list;
        static int initialized = 0;
        struct commit_name *n;

 +      if (get_sha1(arg, sha1) &lt; 0)
 +              usage(describe_usage);
 +      cmit = lookup_commit_reference(sha1);
 +      if (!cmit)
 +              usage(describe_usage);
 +
        if (!initialized) {
                initialized = 1;
                for_each_ref(get_name);
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>It is preceded with a &ldquo;git diff&rdquo; header, that looks like this (when
<em>-c</em> option is used):</p>

<pre><code>diff --combined file
</code></pre>

<p>or like this (when <em>&ndash;cc</em> option is used):</p>

<pre><code>diff --cc file
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>It is followed by one or more extended header lines (this example
shows a merge with two parents):</p>

<pre><code>index &lt;hash&gt;,&lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt;
mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt;
new file mode &lt;mode&gt;
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>mode                     &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt;</code> line appears
only if at least one of the &lt;mode&gt; is different from the rest.
Extended headers with information about detected contents movement
(renames and copying detection) are designed to work with diff of
two &lt;tree-ish&gt; and are not used by combined diff format.</p></li>

<li><p>It is followed by two-line from-file/to-file header</p>

<pre><code>--- a/file
+++ b/file
</code></pre>

<p>Similar to two-line header for traditional <em>unified</em> diff format,
<code>/dev/null</code> is used to signal created or deleted files.</p></li>

<li><p>Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from accidentally
feeding it to <code>patch                   -p1</code>. Combined diff format
was created for review of merge commit changes, and was not meant
for apply. The change is similar to the change in the extended
<em>index</em> header:</p>

<pre><code>@@@ &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;to-file-range&gt; @@@
</code></pre>

<p>There are (number of parents + 1) <code>@</code> characters in the chunk header
for combined diff format.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Unlike the traditional <em>unified</em> diff format, which shows two files A
and B with a single column that has <code>-</code> (minus — appears in A but
removed in B), <code>+</code> (plus — missing in A but added to B), or <code>&quot; &quot;</code>
(space — unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files
file1, file2,… with one file X, and shows how X differs from each of
fileN. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to
note how X’s line is different from it.</p>

<p>A <code>-</code> character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but
it does not appear in the result. A <code>+</code> character in the column N means
that the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have that line
(in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that
parent).</p>

<p>In the above example output, the function signature was changed from
both files (hence two <code>-</code> removals from both file1 and file2, plus <code>++</code>
to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 or
file2). Also eight other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear
in file2 (hence prefixed with <code>+</code>).</p>

<p>When shown by <code>git diff-tree -c</code>, it compares the parents of a merge
commit with the merge result (i.e. file1..fileN are the parents). When
shown by <code>git diff-files -c</code>, it compares the two unresolved merge
parents with the working tree file (i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka &ldquo;our
version&rdquo;, file2 is stage 3 aka &ldquo;their version&rdquo;).</p>

<h2 id="other-diff-formats">other diff formats</h2>

<p>The <code>--summary</code> option describes newly added, deleted, renamed and
copied files. The <code>--stat</code> option adds diffstat(1) graph to the output.
These options can be combined with other options, such as <code>-p</code>, and are
meant for human consumption.</p>

<p>When showing a change that involves a rename or a copy, <code>--stat</code> output
formats the pathnames compactly by combining common prefix and suffix of
the pathnames. For example, a change that moves <code>arch/i386/Makefile</code> to
<code>arch/x86/Makefile</code> while modifying 4 lines will be shown like this:</p>

<pre><code>arch/{i386 =&gt; x86}/Makefile    |   4 +--
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--numstat</code> option gives the diffstat(1) information but is designed
for easier machine consumption. An entry in <code>--numstat</code> output looks
like this:</p>

<pre><code>1       2       README
3       1       arch/{i386 =&gt; x86}/Makefile
</code></pre>

<p>That is, from left to right:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the number of added lines;</p></li>

<li><p>a tab;</p></li>

<li><p>the number of deleted lines;</p></li>

<li><p>a tab;</p></li>

<li><p>pathname (possibly with rename/copy information);</p></li>

<li><p>a newline.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When <code>-z</code> output option is in effect, the output is formatted this way:</p>

<pre><code>1       2       README NUL
3       1       NUL arch/i386/Makefile NUL arch/x86/Makefile NUL
</code></pre>

<p>That is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the number of added lines;</p></li>

<li><p>a tab;</p></li>

<li><p>the number of deleted lines;</p></li>

<li><p>a tab;</p></li>

<li><p>a NUL (only exists if renamed/copied);</p></li>

<li><p>pathname in preimage;</p></li>

<li><p>a NUL (only exists if renamed/copied);</p></li>

<li><p>pathname in postimage (only exists if renamed/copied);</p></li>

<li><p>a NUL.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The extra <code>NUL</code> before the preimage path in renamed case is to allow
scripts that read the output to tell if the current record being read is
a single-path record or a rename/copy record without reading ahead.
After reading added and deleted lines, reading up to <code>NUL</code> would yield
the pathname, but if that is <code>NUL</code>, the record will show two paths.</p>
