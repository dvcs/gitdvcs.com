<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<p>*</p>

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>alternate object database<br />
Via the alternates mechanism, a <a href="#def_repository">repository</a> can
inherit part of its <a href="#def_object_database">object database</a> from
another object database, which is called an &ldquo;alternate&rdquo;.</p></li>

<li><p>bare repository<br />
A bare repository is normally an appropriately named
<a href="#def_directory">directory</a> with a <code>.git</code> suffix that does not have
a locally checked-out copy of any of the files under revision
control. That is, all of the Git administrative and control files
that would normally be present in the hidden <code>.git</code> sub-directory
are directly present in the <code>repository.git</code> directory instead, and
no other files are present and checked out. Usually publishers of
public repositories make bare repositories available.</p></li>

<li><p>blob object<br />
Untyped <a href="#def_object">object</a>, e.g. the contents of a file.</p></li>

<li><p>branch<br />
A &ldquo;branch&rdquo; is an active line of development. The most recent
<a href="#def_commit">commit</a> on a branch is referred to as the tip of that
branch. The tip of the branch is referenced by a branch
<a href="#def_head">head</a>, which moves forward as additional development is
done on the branch. A single Git <a href="#def_repository">repository</a> can
track an arbitrary number of branches, but your <a href="#def_working_tree">working
tree</a> is associated with just one of them (the
&ldquo;current&rdquo; or &ldquo;checked out&rdquo; branch), and <a href="#def_HEAD">HEAD</a> points to
that branch.</p></li>

<li><p>cache<br />
Obsolete for: <a href="#def_index">index</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>chain<br />
A list of objects, where each <a href="#def_object">object</a> in the list
contains a reference to its successor (for example, the successor of
a <a href="#def_commit">commit</a> could be one of its <a href="#def_parent">parents</a>).</p></li>

<li><p>changeset<br />
BitKeeper/cvsps speak for &ldquo;<a href="#def_commit">commit</a>&rdquo;. Since Git does
not store changes, but states, it really does not make sense to use
the term &ldquo;changesets&rdquo; with Git.</p></li>

<li><p>checkout<br />
The action of updating all or part of the <a href="#def_working_tree">working
tree</a> with a <a href="#def_tree_object">tree object</a> or
<a href="#def_blob_object">blob</a> from the <a href="#def_object_database">object
database</a>, and updating the
<a href="#def_index">index</a> and <a href="#def_HEAD">HEAD</a> if the whole working tree
has been pointed at a new <a href="#def_branch">branch</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>cherry-picking<br />
In <a href="#def_SCM">SCM</a> jargon, &ldquo;cherry pick&rdquo; means to choose a subset of
changes out of a series of changes (typically commits) and record
them as a new series of changes on top of a different codebase. In
Git, this is performed by the &ldquo;git cherry-pick&rdquo; command to extract
the change introduced by an existing <a href="#def_commit">commit</a> and to
record it based on the tip of the current <a href="#def_branch">branch</a> as a
new commit.</p></li>

<li><p>clean<br />
A <a href="#def_working_tree">working tree</a> is clean, if it corresponds to
the <a href="#def_revision">revision</a> referenced by the current
<a href="#def_head">head</a>. Also see &ldquo;<a href="#def_dirty">dirty</a>&rdquo;.</p></li>

<li><p>commit<br />
As a noun: A single point in the Git history; the entire history of
a project is represented as a set of interrelated commits. The word
&ldquo;commit&rdquo; is often used by Git in the same places other revision
control systems use the words &ldquo;revision&rdquo; or &ldquo;version&rdquo;. Also used as
a short hand for <a href="#def_commit_object">commit object</a>.</p>

<p>As a verb: The action of storing a new snapshot of the project’s
state in the Git history, by creating a new commit representing the
current state of the <a href="#def_index">index</a> and advancing
<a href="#def_HEAD">HEAD</a> to point at the new commit.</p></li>

<li><p>commit object<br />
An <a href="#def_object">object</a> which contains the information about a
particular <a href="#def_revision">revision</a>, such as
<a href="#def_parent">parents</a>, committer, author, date and the <a href="#def_tree_object">tree
object</a> which corresponds to the top
<a href="#def_directory">directory</a> of the stored revision.</p></li>

<li><p>commit-ish (also committish)<br />
A <a href="#def_commit_object">commit object</a> or an <a href="#def_object">object</a>
that can be recursively dereferenced to a commit object. The
following are all commit-ishes: a commit object, a <a href="#def_tag_object">tag
object</a> that points to a commit object, a tag
object that points to a tag object that points to a commit object,
etc.</p></li>

<li><p>core Git<br />
Fundamental data structures and utilities of Git. Exposes only
limited source code management tools.</p></li>

<li><p>DAG<br />
Directed acyclic graph. The <a href="#def_commit_object">commit objects</a>
form a directed acyclic graph, because they have parents (directed),
and the graph of commit objects is acyclic (there is no
<a href="#def_chain">chain</a> which begins and ends with the same
<a href="#def_object">object</a>).</p></li>

<li><p>dangling object<br />
An <a href="#def_unreachable_object">unreachable object</a> which is not
<a href="#def_reachable">reachable</a> even from other unreachable objects; a
dangling object has no references to it from any reference or
<a href="#def_object">object</a> in the <a href="#def_repository">repository</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>detached HEAD<br />
Normally the <a href="#def_HEAD">HEAD</a> stores the name of a
<a href="#def_branch">branch</a>, and commands that operate on the history HEAD
represents operate on the history leading to the tip of the branch
the HEAD points at. However, Git also allows you to <a href="#def_checkout">check
out</a> an arbitrary <a href="#def_commit">commit</a> that isn’t
necessarily the tip of any particular branch. The HEAD in such a
state is called &ldquo;detached&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Note that commands that operate on the history of the current branch
(e.g. <code>git commit</code> to build a new history on top of it) still work
while the HEAD is detached. They update the HEAD to point at the tip
of the updated history without affecting any branch. Commands that
update or inquire information <em>about</em> the current branch (e.g. <code>git
branch --set-upstream-to</code> that sets what remote-tracking branch the
current branch integrates with) obviously do not work, as there is
no (real) current branch to ask about in this state.</p></li>

<li><p>directory<br />
The list you get with &ldquo;ls&rdquo; :-)</p></li>

<li><p>dirty<br />
A <a href="#def_working_tree">working tree</a> is said to be &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; if it
contains modifications which have not been <a href="#def_commit">committed</a>
to the current <a href="#def_branch">branch</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>evil merge<br />
An evil merge is a <a href="#def_merge">merge</a> that introduces changes that
do not appear in any <a href="#def_parent">parent</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>fast-forward<br />
A fast-forward is a special type of <a href="#def_merge">merge</a> where you
have a <a href="#def_revision">revision</a> and you are &ldquo;merging&rdquo; another
<a href="#def_branch">branch</a>&rsquo;s changes that happen to be a descendant of
what you have. In such a case, you do not make a new
<a href="#def_merge">merge</a> <a href="#def_commit">commit</a> but instead just update to
his revision. This will happen frequently on a <a href="#def_remote_tracking_branch">remote-tracking
branch</a> of a remote
<a href="#def_repository">repository</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>fetch<br />
Fetching a <a href="#def_branch">branch</a> means to get the branch’s <a href="#def_head_ref">head
ref</a> from a remote <a href="#def_repository">repository</a>, to
find out which objects are missing from the local <a href="#def_object_database">object
database</a>, and to get them, too. See also
<a href="../git-fetch">git-fetch(1)</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>file system<br />
Linus Torvalds originally designed Git to be a user space file
system, i.e. the infrastructure to hold files and directories. That
ensured the efficiency and speed of Git.</p></li>

<li><p>Git archive<br />
Synonym for <a href="#def_repository">repository</a> (for arch people).</p></li>

<li><p>gitfile<br />
A plain file <code>.git</code> at the root of a working tree that points at the
directory that is the real repository.</p></li>

<li><p>grafts<br />
Grafts enables two otherwise different lines of development to be
joined together by recording fake ancestry information for commits.
This way you can make Git pretend the set of <a href="#def_parent">parents</a>
a <a href="#def_commit">commit</a> has is different from what was recorded when
the commit was created. Configured via the <code>.git/info/grafts</code> file.</p>

<p>Note that the grafts mechanism is outdated and can lead to problems
transferring objects between repositories; see
<a href="../git-replace">git-replace(1)</a> for a more flexible and robust
system to do the same thing.</p></li>

<li><p>hash<br />
In Git’s context, synonym for <a href="#def_object_name">object name</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>head<br />
A <a href="#def_ref">named reference</a> to the <a href="#def_commit">commit</a> at the
tip of a <a href="#def_branch">branch</a>. Heads are stored in a file in
<code>$GIT_DIR/refs/heads/</code> directory, except when using packed refs.
(See <a href="../git-pack-refs">git-pack-refs(1)</a>.)</p></li>

<li><p>HEAD<br />
The current <a href="#def_branch">branch</a>. In more detail: Your <a href="#def_working_tree">working
tree</a> is normally derived from the state of the
tree referred to by HEAD. HEAD is a reference to one of the
<a href="#def_head">heads</a> in your repository, except when using a <a href="#def_detached_HEAD">detached
HEAD</a>, in which case it directly references an
arbitrary commit.</p></li>

<li><p>head ref<br />
A synonym for <a href="#def_head">head</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>hook<br />
During the normal execution of several Git commands, call-outs are
made to optional scripts that allow a developer to add functionality
or checking. Typically, the hooks allow for a command to be
pre-verified and potentially aborted, and allow for a
post-notification after the operation is done. The hook scripts are
found in the <code>$GIT_DIR/hooks/</code> directory, and are enabled by simply
removing the <code>.sample</code> suffix from the filename. In earlier versions
of Git you had to make them executable.</p></li>

<li><p>index<br />
A collection of files with stat information, whose contents are
stored as objects. The index is a stored version of your <a href="#def_working_tree">working
tree</a>. Truth be told, it can also contain a
second, and even a third version of a working tree, which are used
when <a href="#def_merge">merging</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>index entry<br />
The information regarding a particular file, stored in the
<a href="#def_index">index</a>. An index entry can be unmerged, if a
<a href="#def_merge">merge</a> was started, but not yet finished (i.e. if the
index contains multiple versions of that file).</p></li>

<li><p>master<br />
The default development <a href="#def_branch">branch</a>. Whenever you create a
Git <a href="#def_repository">repository</a>, a branch named &ldquo;master&rdquo; is
created, and becomes the active branch. In most cases, this contains
the local development, though that is purely by convention and is
not required.</p></li>

<li><p>merge<br />
As a verb: To bring the contents of another <a href="#def_branch">branch</a>
(possibly from an external <a href="#def_repository">repository</a>) into the
current branch. In the case where the merged-in branch is from a
different repository, this is done by first <a href="#def_fetch">fetching</a>
the remote branch and then merging the result into the current
branch. This combination of fetch and merge operations is called a
<a href="#def_pull">pull</a>. Merging is performed by an automatic process that
identifies changes made since the branches diverged, and then
applies all those changes together. In cases where changes conflict,
manual intervention may be required to complete the merge.</p>

<p>As a noun: unless it is a <a href="#def_fast_forward">fast-forward</a>, a
successful merge results in the creation of a new
<a href="#def_commit">commit</a> representing the result of the merge, and
having as <a href="#def_parent">parents</a> the tips of the merged
<a href="#def_branch">branches</a>. This commit is referred to as a &ldquo;merge
commit&rdquo;, or sometimes just a &ldquo;merge&rdquo;.</p></li>

<li><p>object<br />
The unit of storage in Git. It is uniquely identified by the
<a href="#def_SHA1">SHA-1</a> of its contents. Consequently, an object can not
be changed.</p></li>

<li><p>object database<br />
Stores a set of &ldquo;objects&rdquo;, and an individual <a href="#def_object">object</a>
is identified by its <a href="#def_object_name">object name</a>. The objects
usually live in <code>$GIT_DIR/objects/</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>object identifier<br />
Synonym for <a href="#def_object_name">object name</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>object name<br />
The unique identifier of an <a href="#def_object">object</a>. The object name
is usually represented by a 40 character hexadecimal string. Also
colloquially called <a href="#def_SHA1">SHA-1</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>object type<br />
One of the identifiers &ldquo;<a href="#def_commit_object">commit</a>&rdquo;,
&ldquo;<a href="#def_tree_object">tree</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="#def_tag_object">tag</a>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;<a href="#def_blob_object">blob</a>&rdquo; describing the type of an
<a href="#def_object">object</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>octopus<br />
To <a href="#def_merge">merge</a> more than two <a href="#def_branch">branches</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>origin<br />
The default upstream <a href="#def_repository">repository</a>. Most projects
have at least one upstream project which they track. By default
<em>origin</em> is used for that purpose. New upstream updates will be
fetched into <a href="#def_remote_tracking_branch">remote-tracking branches</a>
named origin/name-of-upstream-branch, which you can see using <code>git
branch -r</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>pack<br />
A set of objects which have been compressed into one file (to save
space or to transmit them efficiently).</p></li>

<li><p>pack index<br />
The list of identifiers, and other information, of the objects in a
<a href="#def_pack">pack</a>, to assist in efficiently accessing the contents
of a pack.</p></li>

<li><p>pathspec<br />
Pattern used to limit paths in Git commands.</p>

<p>Pathspecs are used on the command line of &ldquo;git ls-files&rdquo;, &ldquo;git
ls-tree&rdquo;, &ldquo;git add&rdquo;, &ldquo;git grep&rdquo;, &ldquo;git diff&rdquo;, &ldquo;git checkout&rdquo;, and
many other commands to limit the scope of operations to some subset
of the tree or worktree. See the documentation of each command for
whether paths are relative to the current directory or toplevel. The
pathspec syntax is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>any path matches itself</p></li>

<li><p>the pathspec up to the last slash represents a directory prefix.
The scope of that pathspec is limited to that subtree.</p></li>

<li><p>the rest of the pathspec is a pattern for the remainder of the
pathname. Paths relative to the directory prefix will be matched
against that pattern using fnmatch(3); in particular, <em>*</em> and
<em>?</em> <em>can</em> match directory separators.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, Documentation/*.jpg will match all .jpg files in the
Documentation subtree, including
Documentation/chapter_1/figure_1.jpg.</p>

<p>A pathspec that begins with a colon <code>:</code> has special meaning. In the
short form, the leading colon <code>:</code> is followed by zero or more &ldquo;magic
signature&rdquo; letters (which optionally is terminated by another colon
<code>:</code>), and the remainder is the pattern to match against the path.
The &ldquo;magic signature&rdquo; consists of ASCII symbols that are neither
alphanumeric, glob, regex special characters nor colon. The optional
colon that terminates the &ldquo;magic signature&rdquo; can be omitted if the
pattern begins with a character that does not belong to &ldquo;magic
signature&rdquo; symbol set and is not a colon.</p>

<p>In the long form, the leading colon <code>:</code> is followed by a open
parenthesis <code>(</code>, a comma-separated list of zero or more &ldquo;magic
words&rdquo;, and a close parentheses <code>)</code>, and the remainder is the
pattern to match against the path.</p>

<p>A pathspec with only a colon means &ldquo;there is no pathspec&rdquo;. This form
should not be combined with other pathspec.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>top<br />
The magic word <code>top</code> (magic signature: <code>/</code>) makes the pattern
match from the root of the working tree, even when you are
running the command from inside a subdirectory.</p></li>

<li><p>literal<br />
Wildcards in the pattern such as <code>*</code> or <code>?</code> are treated as
literal characters.</p></li>

<li><p>icase<br />
Case insensitive match.</p></li>

<li><p>glob<br />
Git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for consumption
by fnmatch(3) with the FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in the
pattern will not match a / in the pathname. For example,
&ldquo;Documentation/*.html&rdquo; matches &ldquo;Documentation/git.html&rdquo; but not
&ldquo;Documentation/ppc/ppc.html&rdquo; or
&ldquo;tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Two consecutive asterisks (&rdquo;<code>**</code>&rdquo;) in patterns matched against
full pathname may have special meaning:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A leading &ldquo;<code>**</code>&rdquo; followed by a slash means match in all
directories. For example, &ldquo;<code>**/foo</code>&rdquo; matches file or
directory &ldquo;<code>foo</code>&rdquo; anywhere, the same as pattern &ldquo;<code>foo</code>&rdquo;.
&ldquo;<code>**/foo/bar</code>&rdquo; matches file or directory &ldquo;<code>bar</code>&rdquo; anywhere
that is directly under directory &ldquo;<code>foo</code>&rdquo;.</p></li>

<li><p>A trailing &ldquo;<code>/**</code>&rdquo; matches everything inside. For example,
&ldquo;<code>abc/**</code>&rdquo; matches all files inside directory &ldquo;abc&rdquo;,
relative to the location of the <code>.gitignore</code> file, with
infinite depth.</p></li>

<li><p>A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash
matches zero or more directories. For example, &ldquo;<code>a/**/b</code>&ldquo;
matches &ldquo;<code>a/b</code>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<code>a/x/b</code>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<code>a/x/y/b</code>&rdquo; and so on.</p></li>

<li><p>Other consecutive asterisks are considered invalid.</p>

<p>Glob magic is incompatible with literal magic.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>exclude<br />
After a path matches any non-exclude pathspec, it will be run
through all exclude pathspec (magic signature: <code>!</code>). If it
matches, the path is ignored.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>parent<br />
A <a href="#def_commit_object">commit object</a> contains a (possibly empty)
list of the logical predecessor(s) in the line of development, i.e.
its parents.</p></li>

<li><p>pickaxe<br />
The term <a href="#def_pickaxe">pickaxe</a> refers to an option to the diffcore
routines that help select changes that add or delete a given text
string. With the <code>--pickaxe-all</code> option, it can be used to view the
full <a href="#def_changeset">changeset</a> that introduced or removed, say, a
particular line of text. See <a href="../git-diff">git-diff(1)</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>plumbing<br />
Cute name for <a href="#def_core_git">core Git</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>porcelain<br />
Cute name for programs and program suites depending on <a href="#def_core_git">core
Git</a>, presenting a high level access to core Git.
Porcelains expose more of a <a href="#def_SCM">SCM</a> interface than the
<a href="#def_plumbing">plumbing</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>per-worktree ref<br />
Refs that are per-<a href="#def_working_tree">worktree</a>, rather than global.
This is presently only <a href="#def_HEAD">HEAD</a> and any refs that start
with <code>refs/bisect/</code>, but might later include other unusual refs.</p></li>

<li><p>pseudoref<br />
Pseudorefs are a class of files under <code>$GIT_DIR</code> which behave like
refs for the purposes of rev-parse, but which are treated specially
by git. Pseudorefs both have names that are all-caps, and always
start with a line consisting of a <a href="#def_SHA1">SHA-1</a> followed by
whitespace. So, HEAD is not a pseudoref, because it is sometimes a
symbolic ref. They might optionally contain some additional data.
<code>MERGE_HEAD</code> and <code>CHERRY_PICK_HEAD</code> are examples. Unlike
<a href="#def_per_worktree_ref">per-worktree refs</a>, these files cannot be
symbolic refs, and never have reflogs. They also cannot be updated
through the normal ref update machinery. Instead, they are updated
by directly writing to the files. However, they can be read as if
they were refs, so <code>git rev-parse MERGE_HEAD</code> will work.</p></li>

<li><p>pull<br />
Pulling a <a href="#def_branch">branch</a> means to <a href="#def_fetch">fetch</a> it and
<a href="#def_merge">merge</a> it. See also <a href="../git-pull">git-pull(1)</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>push<br />
Pushing a <a href="#def_branch">branch</a> means to get the branch’s <a href="#def_head_ref">head
ref</a> from a remote <a href="#def_repository">repository</a>,
find out if it is a direct ancestor to the branch’s local head ref,
and in that case, putting all objects, which are
<a href="#def_reachable">reachable</a> from the local head ref, and which are
missing from the remote repository, into the remote <a href="#def_object_database">object
database</a>, and updating the remote head ref.
If the remote <a href="#def_head">head</a> is not an ancestor to the local
head, the push fails.</p></li>

<li><p>reachable<br />
All of the ancestors of a given <a href="#def_commit">commit</a> are said to be
&ldquo;reachable&rdquo; from that commit. More generally, one
<a href="#def_object">object</a> is reachable from another if we can reach the
one from the other by a <a href="#def_chain">chain</a> that follows
<a href="#def_tag">tags</a> to whatever they tag, <a href="#def_commit_object">commits</a>
to their parents or trees, and <a href="#def_tree_object">trees</a> to the
trees or <a href="#def_blob_object">blobs</a> that they contain.</p></li>

<li><p>rebase<br />
To reapply a series of changes from a <a href="#def_branch">branch</a> to a
different base, and reset the <a href="#def_head">head</a> of that branch to
the result.</p></li>

<li><p>ref<br />
A name that begins with <code>refs/</code> (e.g. <code>refs/heads/master</code>) that
points to an <a href="#def_object_name">object name</a> or another ref (the
latter is called a <a href="#def_symref">symbolic ref</a>). For convenience, a
ref can sometimes be abbreviated when used as an argument to a Git
command; see <a href="../gitrevisions">gitrevisions(7)</a> for details. Refs
are stored in the <a href="#def_repository">repository</a>.</p>

<p>The ref namespace is hierarchical. Different subhierarchies are used
for different purposes (e.g. the <code>refs/heads/</code> hierarchy is used to
represent local branches).</p>

<p>There are a few special-purpose refs that do not begin with <code>refs/</code>.
The most notable example is <code>HEAD</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>reflog<br />
A reflog shows the local &ldquo;history&rdquo; of a ref. In other words, it can
tell you what the 3rd last revision in <em>this</em> repository was, and
what was the current state in <em>this</em> repository, yesterday 9:14pm.
See <a href="../git-reflog">git-reflog(1)</a> for details.</p></li>

<li><p>refspec<br />
A &ldquo;refspec&rdquo; is used by <a href="#def_fetch">fetch</a> and <a href="#def_push">push</a> to
describe the mapping between remote <a href="#def_ref">ref</a> and local ref.</p></li>

<li><p>remote repository<br />
A <a href="#def_repository">repository</a> which is used to track the same
project but resides somewhere else. To communicate with remotes, see
<a href="#def_fetch">fetch</a> or <a href="#def_push">push</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>remote-tracking branch<br />
A <a href="#def_ref">ref</a> that is used to follow changes from another
<a href="#def_repository">repository</a>. It typically looks like
<em>refs/remotes/foo/bar</em> (indicating that it tracks a branch named
<em>bar</em> in a remote named <em>foo</em>), and matches the right-hand-side of a
configured fetch <a href="#def_refspec">refspec</a>. A remote-tracking branch
should not contain direct modifications or have local commits made
to it.</p></li>

<li><p>repository<br />
A collection of <a href="#def_ref">refs</a> together with an <a href="#def_object_database">object
database</a> containing all objects which are
<a href="#def_reachable">reachable</a> from the refs, possibly accompanied by
meta data from one or more <a href="#def_porcelain">porcelains</a>. A
repository can share an object database with other repositories via
<a href="#def_alternate_object_database">alternates mechanism</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>resolve<br />
The action of fixing up manually what a failed automatic
<a href="#def_merge">merge</a> left behind.</p></li>

<li><p>revision<br />
Synonym for <a href="#def_commit">commit</a> (the noun).</p></li>

<li><p>rewind<br />
To throw away part of the development, i.e. to assign the
<a href="#def_head">head</a> to an earlier <a href="#def_revision">revision</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>SCM<br />
Source code management (tool).</p></li>

<li><p>SHA-1<br />
&ldquo;Secure Hash Algorithm 1&rdquo;; a cryptographic hash function. In the
context of Git used as a synonym for <a href="#def_object_name">object
name</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>shallow clone<br />
Mostly a synonym to <a href="#def_shallow_repository">shallow repository</a>
but the phrase makes it more explicit that it was created by running
<code>git clone --depth=...</code> command.</p></li>

<li><p>shallow repository<br />
A shallow <a href="#def_repository">repository</a> has an incomplete history
some of whose <a href="#def_commit">commits</a> have <a href="#def_parent">parents</a>
cauterized away (in other words, Git is told to pretend that these
commits do not have the parents, even though they are recorded in
the <a href="#def_commit_object">commit object</a>). This is sometimes useful
when you are interested only in the recent history of a project even
though the real history recorded in the upstream is much larger. A
shallow repository is created by giving the <code>--depth</code> option to
<a href="../git-clone">git-clone(1)</a>, and its history can be later
deepened with <a href="../git-fetch">git-fetch(1)</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>submodule<br />
A <a href="#def_repository">repository</a> that holds the history of a separate
project inside another repository (the latter of which is called
<a href="#def_superproject">superproject</a>).</p></li>

<li><p>superproject<br />
A <a href="#def_repository">repository</a> that references repositories of
other projects in its working tree as <a href="#def_submodule">submodules</a>.
The superproject knows about the names of (but does not hold copies
of) commit objects of the contained submodules.</p></li>

<li><p>symref<br />
Symbolic reference: instead of containing the <a href="#def_SHA1">SHA-1</a> id
itself, it is of the format <em>ref: refs/some/thing</em> and when
referenced, it recursively dereferences to this reference.
<em><a href="#def_HEAD">HEAD</a></em> is a prime example of a symref. Symbolic
references are manipulated with the
<a href="../git-symbolic-ref">git-symbolic-ref(1)</a> command.</p></li>

<li><p>tag<br />
A <a href="#def_ref">ref</a> under <code>refs/tags/</code> namespace that points to an
object of an arbitrary type (typically a tag points to either a
<a href="#def_tag_object">tag</a> or a <a href="#def_commit_object">commit object</a>). In
contrast to a <a href="#def_head">head</a>, a tag is not updated by the
<code>commit</code> command. A Git tag has nothing to do with a Lisp tag (which
would be called an <a href="#def_object_type">object type</a> in Git’s
context). A tag is most typically used to mark a particular point in
the commit ancestry <a href="#def_chain">chain</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>tag object<br />
An <a href="#def_object">object</a> containing a <a href="#def_ref">ref</a> pointing to
another object, which can contain a message just like a <a href="#def_commit_object">commit
object</a>. It can also contain a (PGP) signature,
in which case it is called a &ldquo;signed tag object&rdquo;.</p></li>

<li><p>topic branch<br />
A regular Git <a href="#def_branch">branch</a> that is used by a developer to
identify a conceptual line of development. Since branches are very
easy and inexpensive, it is often desirable to have several small
branches that each contain very well defined concepts or small
incremental yet related changes.</p></li>

<li><p>tree<br />
Either a <a href="#def_working_tree">working tree</a>, or a <a href="#def_tree_object">tree
object</a> together with the dependent
<a href="#def_blob_object">blob</a> and tree objects (i.e. a stored
representation of a working tree).</p></li>

<li><p>tree object<br />
An <a href="#def_object">object</a> containing a list of file names and modes
along with refs to the associated blob and/or tree objects. A
<a href="#def_tree">tree</a> is equivalent to a <a href="#def_directory">directory</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>tree-ish (also treeish)<br />
A <a href="#def_tree_object">tree object</a> or an <a href="#def_object">object</a> that
can be recursively dereferenced to a tree object. Dereferencing a
<a href="#def_commit_object">commit object</a> yields the tree object
corresponding to the <a href="#def_revision">revision</a>&rsquo;s top
<a href="#def_directory">directory</a>. The following are all tree-ishes: a
<a href="#def_commit-ish">commit-ish</a>, a tree object, a <a href="#def_tag_object">tag
object</a> that points to a tree object, a tag object
that points to a tag object that points to a tree object, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>unmerged index<br />
An <a href="#def_index">index</a> which contains unmerged <a href="#def_index_entry">index
entries</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>unreachable object<br />
An <a href="#def_object">object</a> which is not <a href="#def_reachable">reachable</a>
from a <a href="#def_branch">branch</a>, <a href="#def_tag">tag</a>, or any other
reference.</p></li>

<li><p>upstream branch<br />
The default <a href="#def_branch">branch</a> that is merged into the branch in
question (or the branch in question is rebased onto). It is
configured via branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge. If
the upstream branch of <em>A</em> is <em>origin/B</em> sometimes we say &ldquo;<em>A</em> is
tracking <em>origin/B</em>&rdquo;.</p></li>

<li><p>working tree<br />
The tree of actual checked out files. The working tree normally
contains the contents of the <a href="#def_HEAD">HEAD</a> commit’s tree, plus
any local changes that you have made but not yet committed.</p></li>
