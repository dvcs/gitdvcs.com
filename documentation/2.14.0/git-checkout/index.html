<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<pre><code class="language-content">git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] [&lt;branch&gt;]
git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] --detach [&lt;branch&gt;]
git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] [--detach] &lt;commit&gt;
git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] [[-b|-B|--orphan] &lt;new_branch&gt;] [&lt;start_point&gt;]
git checkout [-f|--ours|--theirs|-m|--conflict=&lt;style&gt;] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] &lt;paths&gt;…
git checkout [-p|--patch] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] [&lt;paths&gt;…]
</code></pre>

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>Updates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or
the specified tree. If no paths are given, <em>git checkout</em> will also
update <code>HEAD</code> to set the specified branch as the current branch.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>git checkout</em> &lt;branch&gt;<br />
To prepare for working on &lt;branch&gt;, switch to it by updating the
index and the files in the working tree, and by pointing HEAD at the
branch. Local modifications to the files in the working tree are
kept, so that they can be committed to the &lt;branch&gt;.</p>

<p>If &lt;branch&gt; is not found but there does exist a tracking branch in
exactly one remote (call it &lt;remote&gt;) with a matching name, treat
as equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; --track &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You could omit &lt;branch&gt;, in which case the command degenerates to
&ldquo;check out the current branch&rdquo;, which is a glorified no-op with a
rather expensive side-effects to show only the tracking information,
if exists, for the current branch.</p></li>

<li><p><em>git checkout</em> -b|-B &lt;new_branch&gt; [&lt;start point&gt;]<br />
Specifying <code>-b</code> causes a new branch to be created as if
<a href="../git-branch">git-branch(1)</a> were called and then checked out.
In this case you can use the <code>--track</code> or <code>--no-track</code> options,
which will be passed to <em>git branch</em>. As a convenience, <code>--track</code>
without <code>-b</code> implies branch creation; see the description of
<code>--track</code> below.</p>

<p>If <code>-B</code> is given, &lt;new_branch&gt; is created if it doesn’t exist;
otherwise, it is reset. This is the transactional equivalent of</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch -f &lt;branch&gt; [&lt;start point&gt;]
$ git checkout &lt;branch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>that is to say, the branch is not reset/created unless &ldquo;git
checkout&rdquo; is successful.</p></li>

<li><p><em>git checkout</em> &ndash;detach [&lt;branch&gt;]<br />
<em>git checkout</em> [&ndash;detach] &lt;commit&gt;<br />
Prepare to work on top of &lt;commit&gt;, by detaching HEAD at it (see
&ldquo;DETACHED HEAD&rdquo; section), and updating the index and the files in
the working tree. Local modifications to the files in the working
tree are kept, so that the resulting working tree will be the state
recorded in the commit plus the local modifications.</p>

<p>When the &lt;commit&gt; argument is a branch name, the <code>--detach</code> option
can be used to detach HEAD at the tip of the branch (<code>git checkout
&lt;branch&gt;</code> would check out that branch without detaching HEAD).</p>

<p>Omitting &lt;branch&gt; detaches HEAD at the tip of the current branch.</p></li>

<li><p><em>git checkout</em> [-p|&ndash;patch] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [&ndash;]
&lt;pathspec&gt;…<br />
When &lt;paths&gt; or <code>--patch</code> are given, <em>git checkout</em> does <strong>not</strong>
switch branches. It updates the named paths in the working tree from
the index file or from a named &lt;tree-ish&gt; (most often a commit).
In this case, the <code>-b</code> and <code>--track</code> options are meaningless and
giving either of them results in an error. The &lt;tree-ish&gt; argument
can be used to specify a specific tree-ish (i.e. commit, tag or
tree) to update the index for the given paths before updating the
working tree.</p>

<p><em>git checkout</em> with &lt;paths&gt; or <code>--patch</code> is used to restore
modified or deleted paths to their original contents from the index
or replace paths with the contents from a named &lt;tree-ish&gt; (most
often a commit-ish).</p>

<p>The index may contain unmerged entries because of a previous failed
merge. By default, if you try to check out such an entry from the
index, the checkout operation will fail and nothing will be checked
out. Using <code>-f</code> will ignore these unmerged entries. The contents
from a specific side of the merge can be checked out of the index by
using <code>--ours</code> or <code>--theirs</code>. With <code>-m</code>, changes made to the working
tree file can be discarded to re-create the original conflicted
merge result.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>-q<br />
--quiet<br />
Quiet, suppress feedback messages.</p></li>

<li><p>&ndash;[no-]progress<br />
Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default
when it is attached to a terminal, unless <code>--quiet</code> is specified.
This flag enables progress reporting even if not attached to a
terminal, regardless of <code>--quiet</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>-f<br />
--force<br />
When switching branches, proceed even if the index or the working
tree differs from HEAD. This is used to throw away local changes.</p>

<p>When checking out paths from the index, do not fail upon unmerged
entries; instead, unmerged entries are ignored.</p></li>

<li><p>&ndash;ours<br />
--theirs<br />
When checking out paths from the index, check out stage #2 (<em>ours</em>)
or #3 (<em>theirs</em>) for unmerged paths.</p>

<p>Note that during <code>git rebase</code> and <code>git pull --rebase</code>, <em>ours</em> and
<em>theirs</em> may appear swapped; <code>--ours</code> gives the version from the
branch the changes are rebased onto, while <code>--theirs</code> gives the
version from the branch that holds your work that is being rebased.</p>

<p>This is because <code>rebase</code> is used in a workflow that treats the
history at the remote as the shared canonical one, and treats the
work done on the branch you are rebasing as the third-party work to
be integrated, and you are temporarily assuming the role of the
keeper of the canonical history during the rebase. As the keeper of
the canonical history, you need to view the history from the remote
as <code>ours</code> (i.e. &ldquo;our shared canonical history&rdquo;), while what you did
on your side branch as <code>theirs</code> (i.e. &ldquo;one contributor’s work on top
of it&rdquo;).</p></li>

<li><p>-b &lt;new_branch&gt;<br />
Create a new branch named &lt;new_branch&gt; and start it at
&lt;start_point&gt;; see <a href="../git-branch">git-branch(1)</a> for details.</p></li>

<li><p>-B &lt;new_branch&gt;<br />
Creates the branch &lt;new_branch&gt; and start it at &lt;start_point&gt;;
if it already exists, then reset it to &lt;start_point&gt;. This is
equivalent to running &ldquo;git branch&rdquo; with &ldquo;-f&rdquo;; see
<a href="../git-branch">git-branch(1)</a> for details.</p></li>

<li><p>-t<br />
--track<br />
When creating a new branch, set up &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; configuration. See
&ldquo;&ndash;track&rdquo; in <a href="../git-branch">git-branch(1)</a> for details.</p>

<p>If no <code>-b</code> option is given, the name of the new branch will be
derived from the remote-tracking branch, by looking at the local
part of the refspec configured for the corresponding remote, and
then stripping the initial part up to the &ldquo;*&rdquo;. This would tell us
to use &ldquo;hack&rdquo; as the local branch when branching off of
&ldquo;origin/hack&rdquo; (or &ldquo;remotes/origin/hack&rdquo;, or even
&ldquo;refs/remotes/origin/hack&rdquo;). If the given name has no slash, or the
above guessing results in an empty name, the guessing is aborted.
You can explicitly give a name with <code>-b</code> in such a case.</p></li>

<li><p>&ndash;no-track<br />
Do not set up &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; configuration, even if the
branch.autoSetupMerge configuration variable is true.</p></li>

<li><p>-l<br />
Create the new branch’s reflog; see <a href="../git-branch">git-branch(1)</a>
for details.</p></li>

<li><p>&ndash;detach<br />
Rather than checking out a branch to work on it, check out a commit
for inspection and discardable experiments. This is the default
behavior of &ldquo;git checkout &lt;commit&gt;&rdquo; when &lt;commit&gt; is not a
branch name. See the &ldquo;DETACHED HEAD&rdquo; section below for details.</p></li>

<li><p>&ndash;orphan &lt;new_branch&gt;<br />
Create a new <em>orphan</em> branch, named &lt;new_branch&gt;, started from
&lt;start_point&gt; and switch to it. The first commit made on this new
branch will have no parents and it will be the root of a new history
totally disconnected from all the other branches and commits.</p>

<p>The index and the working tree are adjusted as if you had previously
run &ldquo;git checkout &lt;start_point&gt;&rdquo;. This allows you to start a new
history that records a set of paths similar to &lt;start_point&gt; by
easily running &ldquo;git commit -a&rdquo; to make the root commit.</p>

<p>This can be useful when you want to publish the tree from a commit
without exposing its full history. You might want to do this to
publish an open source branch of a project whose current tree is
&ldquo;clean&rdquo;, but whose full history contains proprietary or otherwise
encumbered bits of code.</p>

<p>If you want to start a disconnected history that records a set of
paths that is totally different from the one of &lt;start_point&gt;,
then you should clear the index and the working tree right after
creating the orphan branch by running &ldquo;git rm -rf .&rdquo; from the top
level of the working tree. Afterwards you will be ready to prepare
your new files, repopulating the working tree, by copying them from
elsewhere, extracting a tarball, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>&ndash;ignore-skip-worktree-bits<br />
In sparse checkout mode, <code>git checkout -- &lt;paths&gt;</code> would update only
entries matched by &lt;paths&gt; and sparse patterns in
$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout. This option ignores the sparse
patterns and adds back any files in &lt;paths&gt;.</p></li>

<li><p>-m<br />
--merge<br />
When switching branches, if you have local modifications to one or
more files that are different between the current branch and the
branch to which you are switching, the command refuses to switch
branches in order to preserve your modifications in context.
However, with this option, a three-way merge between the current
branch, your working tree contents, and the new branch is done, and
you will be on the new branch.</p>

<p>When a merge conflict happens, the index entries for conflicting
paths are left unmerged, and you need to resolve the conflicts and
mark the resolved paths with <code>git add</code> (or <code>git rm</code> if the merge
should result in deletion of the path).</p>

<p>When checking out paths from the index, this option lets you
recreate the conflicted merge in the specified paths.</p></li>

<li><p>&ndash;conflict=&lt;style&gt;<br />
The same as &ndash;merge option above, but changes the way the
conflicting hunks are presented, overriding the merge.conflictStyle
configuration variable. Possible values are &ldquo;merge&rdquo; (default) and
&ldquo;diff3&rdquo; (in addition to what is shown by &ldquo;merge&rdquo; style, shows the
original contents).</p></li>

<li><p>-p<br />
--patch<br />
Interactively select hunks in the difference between the
&lt;tree-ish&gt; (or the index, if unspecified) and the working tree.
The chosen hunks are then applied in reverse to the working tree
(and if a &lt;tree-ish&gt; was specified, the index).</p>

<p>This means that you can use <code>git checkout -p</code> to selectively discard
edits from your current working tree. See the “Interactive Mode”
section of <a href="../git-add">git-add(1)</a> to learn how to operate the
<code>--patch</code> mode.</p></li>

<li><p>&ndash;ignore-other-worktrees<br />
<code>git checkout</code> refuses when the wanted ref is already checked out by
another worktree. This option makes it check the ref out anyway. In
other words, the ref can be held by more than one worktree.</p></li>

<li><p>&ndash;[no-]recurse-submodules<br />
Using &ndash;recurse-submodules will update the content of all
initialized submodules according to the commit recorded in the
superproject. If local modifications in a submodule would be
overwritten the checkout will fail unless <code>-f</code> is used. If nothing
(or &ndash;no-recurse-submodules) is used, the work trees of submodules
will not be updated.</p></li>

<li><p>&lt;branch&gt;<br />
Branch to checkout; if it refers to a branch (i.e., a name that,
when prepended with &ldquo;refs/heads/&rdquo;, is a valid ref), then that branch
is checked out. Otherwise, if it refers to a valid commit, your HEAD
becomes &ldquo;detached&rdquo; and you are no longer on any branch (see below
for details).</p>

<p>As a special case, the <code>&quot;@{-N}&quot;</code> syntax for the N-th last
branch/commit checks out branches (instead of detaching). You may
also specify <code>-</code> which is synonymous with <code>&quot;@{-1}&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>As a further special case, you may use <code>&quot;A...B&quot;</code> as a shortcut for
the merge base of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> if there is exactly one merge base.
You can leave out at most one of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, in which case it
defaults to <code>HEAD</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>&lt;new_branch&gt;<br />
Name for the new branch.</p></li>

<li><p>&lt;start_point&gt;<br />
The name of a commit at which to start the new branch; see
<a href="../git-branch">git-branch(1)</a> for details. Defaults to HEAD.</p></li>

<li><p>&lt;tree-ish&gt;<br />
Tree to checkout from (when paths are given). If not specified, the
index will be used.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="detached-head">DETACHED HEAD</h2>

<p>HEAD normally refers to a named branch (e.g. <em>master</em>). Meanwhile, each
branch refers to a specific commit. Let’s look at a repo with three
commits, one of them tagged, and with branch <em>master</em> checked out:</p>

<pre><code>           HEAD (refers to branch 'master')
            |
            v
a---b---c  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'c')
    ^
    |
  tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')
</code></pre>

<p>When a commit is created in this state, the branch is updated to refer
to the new commit. Specifically, <em>git commit</em> creates a new commit <em>d</em>,
whose parent is commit <em>c</em>, and then updates branch <em>master</em> to refer to
new commit <em>d</em>. HEAD still refers to branch <em>master</em> and so indirectly
now refers to commit <em>d</em>:</p>

<pre><code>$ edit; git add; git commit

               HEAD (refers to branch 'master')
                |
                v
a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')
    ^
    |
  tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')
</code></pre>

<p>It is sometimes useful to be able to checkout a commit that is not at
the tip of any named branch, or even to create a new commit that is not
referenced by a named branch. Let’s look at what happens when we
checkout commit <em>b</em> (here we show two ways this may be done):</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout v2.0  # or
$ git checkout master^^

   HEAD (refers to commit 'b')
    |
    v
a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')
    ^
    |
  tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that regardless of which checkout command we use, HEAD now refers
directly to commit <em>b</em>. This is known as being in detached HEAD state.
It means simply that HEAD refers to a specific commit, as opposed to
referring to a named branch. Let’s see what happens when we create a
commit:</p>

<pre><code>$ edit; git add; git commit

     HEAD (refers to commit 'e')
      |
      v
      e
     /
a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')
    ^
    |
  tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')
</code></pre>

<p>There is now a new commit <em>e</em>, but it is referenced only by HEAD. We can
of course add yet another commit in this state:</p>

<pre><code>$ edit; git add; git commit

         HEAD (refers to commit 'f')
          |
          v
      e---f
     /
a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')
    ^
    |
  tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, we can perform all the normal Git operations. But, let’s look
at what happens when we then checkout master:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout master

               HEAD (refers to branch 'master')
      e---f     |
     /          v
a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')
    ^
    |
  tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')
</code></pre>

<p>It is important to realize that at this point nothing refers to commit
<em>f</em>. Eventually commit <em>f</em> (and by extension commit <em>e</em>) will be deleted
by the routine Git garbage collection process, unless we create a
reference before that happens. If we have not yet moved away from commit
<em>f</em>, any of these will create a reference to it:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b foo   &lt;1&gt;
$ git branch foo        &lt;2&gt;
$ git tag foo           &lt;3&gt;
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>creates a new branch <em>foo</em>, which refers to commit <em>f</em>, and then
updates HEAD to refer to branch <em>foo</em>. In other words, we’ll no
longer be in detached HEAD state after this command.</p></li>

<li><p>similarly creates a new branch <em>foo</em>, which refers to commit <em>f</em>,
but leaves HEAD detached.</p></li>

<li><p>creates a new tag <em>foo</em>, which refers to commit <em>f</em>, leaving HEAD
detached.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If we have moved away from commit <em>f</em>, then we must first recover its
object name (typically by using git reflog), and then we can create a
reference to it. For example, to see the last two commits to which HEAD
referred, we can use either of these commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ git reflog -2 HEAD # or
$ git log -g -2 HEAD
</code></pre>

<h2 id="argument-disambiguation">ARGUMENT DISAMBIGUATION</h2>

<p>When there is only one argument given and it is not <code>--</code> (e.g. &ldquo;git
checkout abc&rdquo;), and when the argument is both a valid <code>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</code> (e.g.
a branch &ldquo;abc&rdquo; exists) and a valid <code>&lt;pathspec&gt;</code> (e.g. a file or a
directory whose name is &ldquo;abc&rdquo; exists), Git would usually ask you to
disambiguate. Because checking out a branch is so common an operation,
however, &ldquo;git checkout abc&rdquo; takes &ldquo;abc&rdquo; as a <code>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</code> in such a
situation. Use <code>git checkout -- &lt;pathspec&gt;</code> if you want to checkout
these paths out of the index.</p>

<h2 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>The following sequence checks out the <code>master</code> branch, reverts the
<code>Makefile</code> to two revisions back, deletes hello.c by mistake, and
gets it back from the index.</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout master             &lt;1&gt;
$ git checkout master~2 Makefile  &lt;2&gt;
$ rm -f hello.c
$ git checkout hello.c            &lt;3&gt;
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>switch branch</p></li>

<li><p>take a file out of another commit</p></li>

<li><p>restore hello.c from the index</p>

<p>If you want to check out <em>all</em> C source files out of the index,
you can say</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -- '*.c'
</code></pre>

<p>Note the quotes around <code>*.c</code>. The file <code>hello.c</code> will also be
checked out, even though it is no longer in the working tree,
because the file globbing is used to match entries in the index
(not in the working tree by the shell).</p>

<p>If you have an unfortunate branch that is named <code>hello.c</code>, this
step would be confused as an instruction to switch to that
branch. You should instead write:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -- hello.c
</code></pre></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>After working in the wrong branch, switching to the correct branch
would be done using:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout mytopic
</code></pre>

<p>However, your &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; branch and correct &ldquo;mytopic&rdquo; branch may differ
in files that you have modified locally, in which case the above
checkout would fail like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout mytopic
error: You have local changes to 'frotz'; not switching branches.
</code></pre>

<p>You can give the <code>-m</code> flag to the command, which would try a
three-way merge:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -m mytopic
Auto-merging frotz
</code></pre>

<p>After this three-way merge, the local modifications are <em>not</em>
registered in your index file, so <code>git diff</code> would show you what
changes you made since the tip of the new branch.</p></li>

<li><p>When a merge conflict happens during switching branches with the
<code>-m</code> option, you would see something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -m mytopic
Auto-merging frotz
ERROR: Merge conflict in frotz
fatal: merge program failed
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, <code>git diff</code> shows the changes cleanly merged as in the
previous example, as well as the changes in the conflicted files.
Edit and resolve the conflict and mark it resolved with <code>git add</code> as
usual:</p>

<pre><code>$ edit frotz
$ git add frotz
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
